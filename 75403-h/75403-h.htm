<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><img class='dropcap' src='images/capm.jpg' style='float:left;width:5%;' alt='M'/>r.</span> and Mrs. Walter Hibbert had been
married just four months when Aunt
Anne first appeared on the scene. They were
at Brighton, whither they had gone from
Friday to Tuesday, so that Mr. Hibbert might
get braced up after a hard spell of work.
Besides doing his usual journalism, he had
been helping a friend with a popular educational
weekly, and altogether “had slaved
quite wickedly,” so his wife said. But he
had declared that, though he found matrimony,
as far as he had gone, very delightful,
it had to be paid for, especially at the beginning
of its career, when it ran into furniture,
linen, plate, and expensive presents to a dear
little wife, though the expensiveness of the
last he generously kept to himself. So it
resulted in the visit to Brighton. They
spent the happiest four days in the world
there, and felt quite sad when Tuesday
morning arrived. But they wisely did their
best to forget that the evening train would
take them back to London, and resolved
that their last day should pass merrily.</p>

<p>“Suppose we have a long drowsy morning
on the pier,” she suggested; “nothing is
nicer or more restful than to listen to the
band and look down into the water. We
needn’t see the horrid people—indeed, if we
sit on one of the end seats and keep our
faces turned seawards, we can forget that
they even exist.”</p>

<p>Mr. Hibbert solemnly considered the proposal.</p>

<p>“The only drawback is the music, it makes
so much noise—that’s the worst of music,
it always does,” he said sadly. “Another
thing is, that I cannot lie full length on
the pier as I can on the beach.”</p>

<p>“Very well, then we’ll go to the beach.
The worst of the beach is, that we can’t
look down into the water, as we can from
the end of the pier.”</p>

<p>“That’s true; and then there are lots of
pretty girls on the pier, and I like to see
them, for then I know that there are some
left—for the other fellows,” he added nobly.</p>

<p>So they went to the pier, and sat on one
of the side seats at the far end and looked
down into the water, and blinked their happy
eyes at the sunshine. And they felt as if
all the beautiful world belonged to them, as
if they two together were being drawn
dreamily on and on into the sky, and sea,
and light, to make one glorious whole with
happy nature; but a whole in which they
would be for ever conscious of being together,
and never less sleepy or blissful than now.
This was Walter’s idea, and he said it all
in his dear romantic way that generally ended
up with a laugh. “It would never do, you
know, because we should get nothing to
eat.”</p>

<p>“Don’t,” she said. “That is so like you;
you always spoil a beautiful idea, you provoking
thing,” and she rubbed her chin
against the back of the seat and looked
down more intently at the water. Without
any one in the least suspecting it, he
managed to stoop and kiss her hand, while
he pretended to be trying to see something,
that of course was not there, at the top of
a wave.</p>

<p>They were having a delightful morning,
they lived in every moment of it, and wished
it would never come to an end; still, when
it did, there would be a delicious luncheon
to go back to—very large prawns, roast
chicken and green peas, and an enormous
dish of ripe figs, which both their souls
loved. After all, Walter thought, the world
was not a bad place, especially when you
had a wife who adored you and thought that
everything you did bore the stamp of genius.</p>

<p>The band was playing a waltz, though to
this day they do not know it. All manner
of people were passing to and fro, but they
did not notice them.</p>

<p>“I should like to stay here for ever,”
Mrs. Hibbert said, with a sweet sigh of
content. “Do you know, Walter,” she
went on suddenly after a pause, “it will
be four months to-morrow since we were
married? Time seems to have flown.”</p>

<p>“By Jove! it really is a miracle what
those four months have done with themselves,”
he answered, looking up for a
moment; as if to be sure that Time was
not a conjurer standing before him about
to hand the four months from beneath a
handkerchief, with a polite bow and the
remark that they would have to be lived
through at the ordinary rate.</p>

<p>A spare-looking old lady, dressed in black,
passed by, but he did not notice her.</p>

<p>“You see,” he went on, with his eyes fixed
on a sailing boat in the distance, “if things
were always going to be——”</p>

<p>At the sound of his voice the lady in
black, who was only a few yards off, stopped,
listened, hesitated, and, turning back, stood
before him. He recognized her in a moment.</p>

<p>“Aunt Anne!” he exclaimed. His voice
was amiable, but embarrassed, as if he did
not quite know what to do next.</p>

<p>“My dear Walter,” she said, with a sigh
and in a tone of great relief, “I am so glad
to find you; I went to your lodgings, I saw
your name and address in the visitors’ list
yesterday, but you were out; then I thought
I might find you here. And this is your
wife? My dear Florence, I am so glad to
see you.”</p>

<p>Till that moment Mrs. Walter Hibbert
had never heard of the existence of Aunt
Anne, but Aunt Anne had evidently heard
of Mrs. Hibbert. She knew her Christian
name, and called her by it as naturally as
if she had been at her christening. She
stretched out a small hand covered with a
black thread glove as she spoke, and held
Florence’s fingers affectionately in hers.
Florence looked at her a little wonderingly.
Aunt Anne was slight and old, nearly sixty
perhaps. All over her face there were
little lines that crossed and re-crossed, and
branched off in every direction. She had
grey hair, and small dark eyes that blinked
quickly and nervously; there appeared to be
some trifling affection of the left eye, for now
and then, as if by accident, it winked at you.
The odd thing was that, in spite of her evident
tendency to nervous excitement, her
shabby black satin dress, almost threadbare
shawl, and cheap gloves, there was an air
of dignity about the spare old lady, and
something like determination in her kindly
voice that, joined to her impulsive tenderness,
made you quickly understand she would
be a very difficult person to oppose.</p>

<p>“Dear boy,” she said gently to Walter,
“why didn’t you write to me when you were
married? You know how glad I should
have been to hear of your happiness.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you write to me, Aunt
Anne?” he asked, gaily turning the tables.</p>

<p>“Yes, I ought to have done so. You
must forgive me, dears, for being so remiss,”
she said, looking at them both, “and believe
me that it was from no lack of affection.
But,” she went on quickly, “we must not
waste our time. You are coming to Rottingdean
with me, and at once. Mr. Baines is
longing to see you both.”</p>

<p>“But we can’t go now, Aunt Anne,”
Walter declared in his kindest manner; “we
must get back to the lodgings. We told
them to have luncheon ready at one o’clock,
and to-night we go home. You must come
and lunch with us.”</p>

<p>“That is impossible, dear Walter; you are
coming back with me.”</p>

<p>“It can’t be done to-day,” he said regretfully.</p>

<p>“My dear Walter,” she answered, with a
look of dismay and in a voice that was
almost pained, “what would your uncle say
if he heard you? I could not possibly
return without you.”</p>

<p>“But he has never seen me, Aunt Anne.”</p>

<p>“That is one reason why he would never
forgive me if I did not take you back.”</p>

<p>“But it is so far, and we should be all
day getting there,” Walter objected a little
helplessly, for he felt already that Aunt Anne
would carry her point.</p>

<p>“It is only to Rottingdean”—she spoke
with hurt surprise—“and we will drive. I
saw a beautiful fly as I was coming on to the
pier, and engaged it. I know you too well,
my darling, to think that you will refuse
me.”</p>

<p>Her manner had changed in a moment;
she said the last words with soft triumph,
and looked at Florence. The sight of the
young wife seemed to be too much for her;
there was something like a tear in the left
eye, the one that winked, when she spoke
again.</p>

<p>“I must give her a kiss,” she said tenderly,
and putting out her arms she gathered the
girl to her heart. “But we must make
haste,” she went on quickly, hurrying over
the fag end of her embrace, as if she had not
time to indulge in her feelings much as she
desired to do so. “Mr. Baines will wonder
what has happened to us. He is longing to
see you;” and without their knowing it, she
almost chased them along the pier.</p>

<p>Then Walter, thinking of the prawns and
the chicken and the large dish of ripe green
figs, made a wild struggle to get free.</p>

<p>“But really, Aunt Anne,” he said firmly,
“we must go back to the lodgings. Come
and lunch with us now, and let us go and
see Mr. Baines another time; I dare say we
shall be at Brighton again soon. We will
make a point of coming now that we know
you are here, won’t we, Floggie?” and he
appealed feebly to his wife.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed we will,” Florence assured
her.</p>

<p>“Dear children,” Aunt Anne laughed, “I
shall not take any excuse, or think of letting
you escape now that I have found you.”
There was an unexpected brightness in her
manner, but there was no intention of letting
them go.</p>

<p>“Besides, there may be important letters
at the lodgings, and I ought to do a bit of
work;” but there was evident invention in
Walter’s voice, and she did not slacken her
pace. Still, as if she wanted him to know
that she saw through his excuses, she looked
at him reproachfully, and with a determination
that did not falter.</p>

<p>“It would be impossible for me to return
without you,” she said, with extreme gravity;
“he would never forgive me. Besides, dear
children, you don’t know what a pleasure it
is to see you. I could not let you go just
yet. My heart gave a bound as I recognized
Walter’s voice,” she went on, turning to
Florence; “he is so like what his dear
father used to be. I knew him directly.”</p>

<p>They were already by the turnstile. They
felt helpless. The old lady with the thin
shoulders and the black shawl loosely floating
behind seemed to be their master: they
were like children doing as they were told.</p>

<p>“Here is the fly. Get in, my darlings,”
she said triumphantly, and Florence meekly
took her place. “Get in, dear Walter,” she
repeated with decision, “I will follow; get
in,” and he too obeyed. Another moment
and they were going towards Rottingdean.</p>

<p>The old lady looked relieved and pleased
when they were well on their way.</p>

<p>“It is a lovely drive,” she said, “and it
will do you far more good than sitting on
the pier. I am so glad to have you with me,
dear children.” She seemed to delight in
calling them children, and it was odd, but
each time that she said the word it seemed
to give her a stronger hold on them. She
turned to Florence.</p>

<p>“Are your father and mother quite well,
my dear?” she asked, and waited with
polite eagerness for a reply.</p>

<p>Walter put his hand on his wife’s.</p>

<p>“She only has a mother,” he said gently.</p>

<p>Aunt Anne looked quite penitent. She
winked with her left eye and was silent for
a moment or two, almost as if she meditated
shedding a tear for the defunct father of the
niece by marriage whom she had never seen
in her life before to-day. Suddenly she
turned the subject so grotesquely that they
nearly laughed.</p>

<p>“Are you fond of chocolates, my darling?”</p>

<p>“Yes——” Florence hesitated a minute
and then said softly, “Yes, Aunt Anne,
very”—she had not had occasion to give the
old lady any name in the few words she had
spoken previously.</p>

<p>“Dear child, I knew you would be,” Aunt
Anne said, and from under her shawl she
produced a box covered with white satin
paper and having on its lid a very bright
picture of a very smart lady. “I bought
that box of chocolates for you as I came
along. I thought Florence would be like
the picture on the lid,” she added, turning to
her nephew; “and she is, don’t you think
so, Walter dear?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Aunt Anne, she is—it is a most
beautiful lady,” he answered, and he looked
fondly at his wife and drew up his lips a
little bit in a manner that Florence knew
meant, in the language only she and he in
all the wide world understood, that in his
thoughts he kissed her.</p>

<p>Aunt Anne was a dear old lady, Florence
thought, and of course she liked, and always
would like, any relation of Walter’s; still,
she did so wish that on this particular day,
their last by the sea together, Aunt Anne
had kept her distance. Walter was so pale
when they left town, but since Friday, with
nothing to do but to get brown in the sun,
he had been looking better and handsomer
every day, and this last one they had longed
to enjoy in their own lazy way; and now
all their little plans were spoilt. To-morrow
he would be at his office: it was really too
bad, though it was ungrateful to think it,
perhaps, with the remembrance of Aunt
Anne’s embrace fresh upon her, and the
box of chocolates on her lap. Still, after
all, she felt justified, for she knew that
Walter was raging inwardly, and that if
they were alone he would use some short
but very effective words to describe his own
feeling in respect to the turning up of Aunt
Anne. Only he was so good, so gentle
and considerate, that, no matter what his
thoughts might be, of course he would not
let Aunt Anne feel how much her kindness
bothered him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, they jogged along in the open
fly towards Rottingdean. A long, even
road, with a view on the right of the open
sea, on the left alternate high hedges and
wide meadows. The grass on the cliffs
was green; among the grass were little
footpaths made by wandering feet that had
diverged from the main road. Florence
followed the little tracks with her eyes; she
thought of footpaths like them far away, not
by the sea, but among the hanging woods
of Surrey. She and Walter had sauntered
along them less than a year ago. She
thought of home, of the dear mother busy
with her household duties, but making time
between to write to the boys in India; of
the dear, noisy boys who suddenly grew
to be young men and vanished into the
whirl of life; of the dirty old pony carriage
in which she had loved to drive her sweetheart;
and when she got to this point her
thoughts came to a full stop to think more
particularly of the pony. His name was
Moses, and he had liked being kissed and
eating sugar. She remembered, with a pang
of self-reproach, that in the last months
before her marriage she used to forget to
kiss Moses, though she often stood absently
stroking his patient nose. She had sometimes
even forgotten his morning lump of
sugar in the excitement of reading the letter
that the early post never failed to bring.</p>

<p>“Are you fond of scenery, dear?” Aunt
Anne asked.</p>

<p>With a start Florence looked round at
the old lady, at Walter, at the shabby lining
of the fly.</p>

<p>“Yes, very,” she answered.</p>

<p>“I knew it by the expression of your face
when you looked at the sea. Mr. Baines
says it is a lovely view.”</p>

<p>Why should Mr. Baines be quoted?
Florence wondered. She looked again—an
open sea, a misty horizon, a blue sky,
and the sun shining. A fine sea-view,
certainly, and a splendid day, but scenery
was hardly the term to apply to the distance
beside them.</p>

<p>“Is Mr. Baines very fond of the sea?”
she asked. She saw that Aunt Anne was
waiting for her to speak, and she said the
first words that presented themselves.</p>

<p>“Yes, my love, he delights in scenery.
You must call him Uncle Robert, Florence.
He would be deeply wounded to hear you
say Mr. Baines. Neither he nor I could
think of Walter’s wife as anything but our
niece. You will remember, won’t you, my
love?” Aunt Anne spoke in the gentle
but authoritative voice which was, as they
had already found, difficult to resist.</p>

<p>“Yes, Aunt Anne, of course I will if you
wish it; it was only because as yet I do not
know him.”</p>

<p>“But you soon will know him, my love,”
the old lady answered confidently; “and
when you do, you will feel that neither he
nor I could think of Walter’s wife except
to love her. Dear child, how fond he will
be of you!” And she put her hand affectionately
on Florence’s while she turned to
Walter and asked suddenly—</p>

<p>“Walter dear, have you got a white silk
handkerchief for your neck?”</p>

<p>He looked at her for a moment, almost
puzzled, wondering whether she wanted to
borrow one.</p>

<p>“No, Aunt Anne, I fear I have not.”</p>

<p>She dived down into her pocket and
pulled out a little soft packet. “I thought
it possible you hadn’t one,” she said joyfully,
“so I bought this for you just now;” and
she tucked the little parcel into his hand.</p>

<p>It took him by surprise, he did not know
what to say. He felt like the schoolboy she
seemed to take him for, and a schoolboy’s
awkwardness overtook him; he smiled,
nodded mysteriously, and put the handkerchief
into his pocket. His manner
delighted Mrs. Baines.</p>

<p>“He is just the same,” she said to
Florence; “I remember him so well when
he was only ten years old. He had the
most lovely eyes I ever saw. Walter, do
you remember my visit to your father?—Ah!
we have reached the hill, that’s why
he’s going so slowly,” she exclaimed excitedly.
“We shall be there in five minutes.
Now we are close to the village. Drive
through the street, coachman,” she called
out, “past the church, and a little way on
you will see a house standing back from the
road with a long garden in front and a white
gate. Florence dear,” she asked, still keeping
her eyes fixed on the driver, “do you
like preserve?”</p>

<p>“Like—do you mean jam?” Florence
asked, bewildered by another sudden question.</p>

<p>“Yes, my love, preserve,” Aunt Anne
answered pointedly, as if she resented the
use of the shorter word.</p>

<p>“Yes, I like it very much,” her newly
found niece said humbly, feeling that she
had been rebuked.</p>

<p>“We have quantities of fruit in our garden,
and have been preserving it all the week.
It is not very firm yet, but you must have
some to take back with you.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid we shall hardly be able to
carry it,” Florence began timidly, feeling
convinced that if she were made to carry
jam to London it would be fatal to the rest
of her luggage.</p>

<p>“I will pack it for you myself,” Aunt
Anne said firmly. She was watching the
driver too intently to say more. She did
not speak again till they had driven down
the one street of Rottingdean, past the
newly built cottages and the church, and
appeared to be getting into another main
road. Then suddenly she rose triumphantly
from her seat. “There it is, coachman,
that little cottage to the left. Dear Walter—how
pleased your uncle will be! Here
it is, dears,” and all her kindly face lighted
up with satisfaction as they stopped before
a small whitewashed cottage with a long
garden in front and a bed of lupins at the
side. Florence noticed that the garden,
stretching far behind, was full of fruit-trees,
and that a pear-tree rubbed against the sides
of the house.</p>

<p>The old lady got out of the fly slowly,
she handed out her niece and nephew; the
latter was going to pay the driver, but she
pushed away his hand, then stood for a
moment feeling absently in her pocket.
After a moment she looked up and said
in an abstracted voice, “Walter dear, you
must settle with the flyman when you go
back to Brighton; he is paid by the hour
and will wait for you, my darlings;” and
she turned towards the gate. “Come,” she
said, “I must present you to your uncle.—Robert,”
she called, “are you there?” She
walked along the pathway with a quick
determined step a little in advance of her
visitors: when she reached the house she
stood still, looking in, but hesitating to enter.
Florence and Walter overtaking her saw
that the front door opened into a room
simply, almost poorly, furnished, with many
photographs dotted about the walls, and a
curious arrangement of quartz and ferns
in one corner. While Mrs. Baines stood
irresolute, there came round the house
from the right a little shabby-looking maid-servant.
Her dress was dirty, and she wore
a large cap on her untidy head.</p>

<p>“Emma,” said Aunt Anne in the condescending
voice of one who struggled, but
unsuccessfully, to forget her own superior
condition in life, “where is your master?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, mum, but I think he’s
tying up the beans.”</p>

<p>“Have you prepared luncheon?”</p>

<p>The girl looked up in surprise she evidently
did not dare express, and answered
in the negative.</p>

<p>“Then go and do so immediately.”</p>

<p>“But please, mum, what am I to put on
the table?” asked the girl, bewildered.</p>

<p>“Put!” exclaimed the old lady; “why,
the cold bacon, and the preserved cranberries,
of course, and the honey and the buns.”</p>

<p>Florence thought that it sounded like the
oddest meal in the world.</p>

<p>“I think we had better return, I do indeed,
Aunt Anne, if you will kindly let us,” urged
Walter, thinking regretfully of the chicken.</p>

<p>Aunt Anne waved her hand.</p>

<p>“Walter,” she answered grandly, “you
shall not go until you have partaken of our
hospitality. I wish it were a thousand
times better than it is,” she added, with a
pathetic note in her voice that found their
hearts directly.</p>

<p>Walter put his hand on her shoulder like
the simple affectionate fellow he was, and
Florence hastened to say heartily—</p>

<p>“It sounds delightful, dear Aunt Anne;
it is only that we——” And then there came
slouching round the left side of the house
a tall ungainly-looking man of about sixty,
a man with a brown beard and brown
trousers, carrying in his hand a newspaper.
He looked at Walter and at Florence in
almost stupid surprise, and turned from
them with a grunt.</p>

<p>“Anne,” he said crossly, “where have
you been? I have wasted all my morning
looking for you; you knew those scarlet
runners wanted tying up, and the sunflowers
trimming. Who are these?” he asked,
nodding at his visitors as coolly as if they
had been out of hearing; “and what is that
fly doing at the gate?”</p>

<p>“Why, I have been to Brighton, of
course,” Aunt Anne answered bravely,
lifting her head and looking him in the
face, but there was a quaver of something
like fear in her voice; “I told you I was
going: I went by the omnibus.”</p>

<p>“What did you go to Brighton for? you
were there only last week.” He lowered
his voice and asked again, “Who are these?”</p>

<p>“Robert, I told you yesterday that Walter
Hibbert’s name was in the visitors’ list in
the paper, and that I was longing to see
him and his wife,” she answered sharply,
but still with dignity—it was doubtful which
of the two was master—“so of course I went
off this morning to fetch them. I knew
how glad you would be to see them.”</p>

<p>Mr. Baines gave a grunt.</p>

<p>The maid, laying the cloth in the whitewashed
sitting-room, stopped clattering the
forks and spoons to hear what was going
on and to look through the open window.
Aunt Anne noticed it in a moment, and
turning round said sternly—</p>

<p>“Emma, proceed with your work. I told
you,” she went on, again speaking to her
husband, “that these dear children were at
Brighton. I have brought them back,
Robert, to introduce them to you. They
have been looking forward to it.”</p>

<p>He gave another grunt, and shook his
awkward shoulders in what was meant to
be a civil manner.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s it,” he said; “well, you had
better come in and have something to eat.”
And he led the way into the cottage.</p>

<p>Aunt Anne entirely recovered herself the
moment she was under her own roof. “He
is so forgetful,” she said softly, “but he has
really been longing to see you;” and she
touched his arm: “I told them how glad
you would be to see them, Robert,” she
said appealingly, as if she felt quite certain
that he would remember his gladness in a
moment or two, and wondered if it was yet
flowing into his heart. “Dear Florence,
you must ask him to show you his botanical
specimens; he has a wonderful collection.”</p>

<p>“We will,” said Walter, good-humouredly.</p>

<p>“And now you must excuse me for a
few minutes, dears. I know how much
your uncle will enjoy a talk with you;” and,
to the dismay of the Hibberts, Aunt Anne
vanished, leaving them alone with the brown
man.</p>

<p>Mr. Baines sat slowly down on the arm-chair,
the only really comfortable one in the
room, and stretched out his left leg in a
manner that showed it was stiff. Then he
looked at his visitors grimly, yet with a
suggestion of odd amusement on his face,
as if he knew perfectly how embarrassed
they felt.</p>

<p>“Sit down, Mrs. Hibbert,” he said, nodding
towards an ordinary chair, and including
Walter in the nod. “I dare say you’ll be
glad of your food before you look at specimens.
I shall,” and he gave a lumbering
laugh. “I have done a hard morning’s
work.”</p>

<p>“I am sure you must be very tired,”
Florence said politely, wishing Aunt Anne
would return.</p>

<p>He seemed to know her thoughts, and
answered them in an explanatory manner:
“Anne won’t be long. She always dresses
before we have dinner. Great nonsense,
living as we do; but it’s no use my speaking.
Do you make a long stay in Brighton,
Mr. Hibbert?”</p>

<p>“No, we go back to town to-night.”</p>

<p>“A good thing,” he said, with another
lumbering laugh; “Brighton is a horrible
place to my mind, and the sooner one leaves
it the better. That pier, with its band and
set of idle people, with nothing else to do
but to walk up and down;—well, it’s my
opinion that railways have done a vast deal
of mischief and mighty little good to make
up for it. The same thing can be said of
newspapers. What good do they do?”</p>

<p>Walter felt that this sudden turn upon
the Press was a little hard on him, but he
looked up over his moustache with laughter
in his eyes, and wondered what would come
next. Florence was almost angry. Aunt
Anne’s husband was very rude, she thought,
and she determined to come to the rescue.</p>

<p>“But you were reading a paper,” she said,
and tried to see the name of one that Mr.
Baines had thrown down beside his chair.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; I like to try and find out what
mischief they are going to do next. If I
had my way they should only be published
monthly, if at all. All they do is to try and
set people by the ears.”</p>

<p>“But they tell us the news.”</p>

<p>“Well, and what better are we for that?
I don’t want to know that a man was hanged
last week, and a prince will be married to-morrow;
I only waste my time reading
about them when I might be usefully employed
minding my own business.”</p>

<p>“Walter writes for a paper,” Florence
said distantly, determined to find out if Mr.
Baines was being rude on purpose. A little
dull curiosity came into his eyes, as he
looked up and asked—</p>

<p>“Walter—who’s Walter?”</p>

<p>“I am,” laughed the owner of the name;
“but she needn’t have betrayed me.” Mr.
Baines was in no way disconcerted.</p>

<p>“Oh! you write for a paper, do you?
Well, I am sorry for you; you might do
something much better. Oh, here’s Anne;
now we had better go and eat.” With the
aid of a stick, he shuffled out of the chair,
refusing Walter’s offered help. “I didn’t
know you wrote for a paper, or I would
have held my tongue,” he said, as a sort of
apology. “No, thank you, I am all right
once I am on my feet.”</p>

<p>Florence and Walter were astonished
when they looked at Aunt Anne. They
hardly knew her again. The shabby black
shawl had vanished, the dusty bonnet was
replaced by a soft white cap; there was lace
at her throat fastened by a little crinkly gold
brooch that had a place for hair in the
middle: her satin dress trailed an inch or
two on the ground behind, and she had put
a red carnation in her bosom almost coquettishly.</p>

<p>“Now, dears,” she said, with a smile of
welcome that was fascinating from its absolute
genuineness, “I shall be truly hurt if
you fail to do justice to our simple repast”—and
she sat down with an air of old-fashioned
stateliness as if she were heading a banquet
table. “Sit down, dears. Robert, you must
have Florence on your right hand.”</p>

<p>The Hibberts took their places merrily,
their spirits reviving now that they were
no longer alone with their host. Aunt
Anne, too, looked so picturesque sitting
there in the little summer-like room, with
the garden beyond, that they could not help
being glad they had come. They felt that
they were living a distinct day in their lives,
and not one that afterwards in looking back
they would find difficult to sort out from a
hundred others like it.</p>

<p>Even Mr. Baines grew less grumpy, and
offered presently to show them the garden.</p>

<p>“And the plum-trees and the pear-trees,”
said Aunt Anne; “and the view from the
summer-house in the corner.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes,” her husband said, “we’ll show
them all;” and he helped to do the honours
of the table with what he evidently intended
to be genial courtesy.</p>

<p>“It does my heart good to see you,
dears,” Aunt Anne said, as she insisted on
helping them to an enormous quantity of
stewed cranberries.</p>

<p>“And it does us good to be here,” they
answered, forgetting all their vexation at
losing a day by the sea; forgetting even the
poor chicken that was being roasted in vain,
and the waiting fly to be paid for at so much
an hour.</p>

<p>“Walter dear,” Mrs. Hibbert said, as they
drove back to Brighton, carefully balancing
on their knees four large pots of jam, while
they also kept an eye on an enormous nosegay
badly tied up, that wobbled about on
the back seat, “Mr. Baines didn’t seem to
know you when we arrived.”</p>

<p>“He had never set eyes on me before.
Aunt Anne only set eyes on him five years
ago. He was rather a grumpy beggar. I
wonder who the deuce he was? We none
of us ever knew.”</p>

<p>“He didn’t know you were a journalist,
I think.”</p>

<p>“No, I suppose not. I wonder if he ever
did anything for a living himself?” Then, as
if he repented saying anything that sounded
unkind of a man whose salt he had just
eaten, he added, “But you can never tell
what people are from their talk the first time
you see them. He is not unlike a man I
knew some years ago, who was a great inventive
genius. He used to shuffle about
in shoes too big for him, just as this beggar
did.”</p>

<p>“I felt quite frightened when he first came
round the corner.”</p>

<p>“You see it was rough upon him having
his morning spoilt. A man who lives in the
country like that generally gets wrapped up
in his surroundings. I suppose I must have
known that Aunt Anne was at Rottingdean,”
he went on; “but if so, I had forgotten it.
She quarrelled with my father and every one
else because she was always quite unable to
keep any money. There was a great deliberation
in the family a few years ago,
when it was announced that Aunt Anne was
destitute and no one wanted to keep her.”</p>

<p>“But had she no money of her own?”</p>

<p>“She had a little, but she lived on the
capital till it was gone, and there was an
end of that. Then suddenly she married
Mr. Baines. I don’t know who he was, but
she met him at a railway station. He had
a bad headache, I believe, and she thought
he was ill, and went up and offered him
some smelling-salts.”</p>

<p>“Why, it was quite romantic,” Florence
exclaimed.</p>

<p>Walter had a curious way of looking up
when he was amused, and he looked up in
that curious way now.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, “quite romantic.”</p>

<p>“Do go on.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know any more except that somehow
they got married, and she turned up
to-day as you saw; and I wish she hadn’t
given us any jam, confound it. I say,
darling, let’s throw it over that hedge.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I wouldn’t for the world,” Florence
said. “It would be so unkind. She was
a dear old lady, Walter, and I am glad we
went to see her. She asked for our address
in London, and said she should write to us.”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p>But Aunt Anne did not write for a long
time, and then it was only to condole with
Walter on the death of his father. The first
year after their visit to Rottingdean she sent
a large Christmas card inscribed to “My
dear Walter and Florence, from Aunt Anne;”
but the second year even this was omitted.
It was not until Mr. and Mrs. Hibbert had
been married nearly seven years that Aunt
Anne again appeared before them.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER II.</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><img class='dropcap' src='images/capm.jpg' style='float:left;width:5%;' alt='M'/>any</span> things had happened to Mr. and
Mrs. Hibbert in those seven years.
Most important of all—to themselves, at
least—was the birth of their two children,
lovely children Mrs. Hibbert declared them
to be, and in his heart her husband agreed
with her. But the time came when Walter
found to his dismay that even lovely children
would sometimes cry, and that as they grew
older they wanted room to run about with
that constant patter-pattering sound that is
usually more delightful to a mother’s ear than
to a fathers, especially when he has to produce
intelligible copy. So the Hibberts
moved away from the little flat in which they
had begun their married life, to an ugly little
upright house sufficiently near Portland Road
to enable Walter to get quickly to the office.
There a nursery could be made at the top of
the house, where the children would be not
only out of sight, but out of hearing.</p>

<p>Walter did a great deal of work, and was
fairly well paid, but that did not mean a
large income for a young couple with two
children and three servants, trying to keep
up an appearance before the world. He
wrote for magazines and literary journals,
occasionally he did a long pot-boiler for one
of those reviews he called refuges for destitute
intellects; and altogether was thrown much
among men better off than himself, so that
he did not like to look poor. Besides, he
preferred to live with a certain amount of
comfort, even though it meant a certain
amount of anxiety, to looking poverty-stricken
or shabby for the sake of knowing precisely
how he would stand at the end of the quarter,
or being able at any moment to lay his hand
on a ten-pound note.</p>

<p>“You not only feel awkward yourself if
you look poor, but cause other people to feel
so,” he said; “and that is making yourself a
nuisance: you have no business to do that
if you can avoid it.”</p>

<p>So, though the Hibberts had only a small
house, it was pretty and well arranged.
Their simple meals were daintily served, and
everything about them had an air that
implies content dashed with luxury. In fact,
they lived as people can live now, even on a
small income, and especially in London, in
comfort and refinement.</p>

<p>Still, it was a difficult task to pull through,
and Walter felt that he ought to be making
more money. He knew, too, though he did
not tell his wife so, that the constant work
and anxiety were telling on him; he wanted
another but a far longer bracing-up than the
one he had had seven years ago at Brighton.
“A sea voyage would be the thing,” he
thought, “only I don’t see how it could be
managed, even if I could get away.”</p>

<p>The last year had been a fortunate one in
some respects: an aunt of Mrs. Hibbert’s
had died, leaving them a hundred pounds
and a furnished cottage near Witley, in
Surrey. It was a dear little cottage, they
both protested—red brick, of course, as all
well-bred cottages are nowadays, standing in
an acre and a half of its own fir-wood, and
having round it a garden with tan paths and
those prim flowers that grow best in the
vicinity of fir. It would be delightful to stay
there in the summer holidays, they agreed,
or to run down from Saturday to Monday,
or, by-and-by, to send the children there for
a spell with the governess when their parents
were not able to get away from town.
Walter had tried sending Florence and the
children and going down every week himself,
but he found “it didn’t work.” She was
always longing to be with him, and he with
her. It was only a broad sea and a few
thousand miles that would make separation
possible, and he did not think he could
endure that very long: he was absurdly fond
of his dear little wife.</p>

<p>All this he thought over as he walked
along the Strand one morning to his office.
He was going to see his chief, who had sent
for him on a matter of business. His chief
was Mr. Fisher, an excellent editor, though
not quite enough of a partisan perhaps to
have a strong following. <span class='it'>The Centre</span> was a
model of fairness, and the mainstay of that
great section of the reading public that likes
its news trustworthy and copious, but has no
pronounced party leanings. Still, if it was a
paper without political influence, it was one
of great political use, for it invariably stated
a question from all points of view with equal
fairness, though it leant, if at all, from sheer
editorial generosity, towards making the best
of it for the weakest side. Thus a minority
looked to it almost as to an advocate, and
the majority knew that any strength that
was against them would be set forth in <span class='it'>The
Centre</span>, and that if none was pleaded there,
the right and the triumph were together.
Mr. Fisher liked Walter Hibbert; and
though by tacit agreement their relations
inside the office were purely formal, outside
they were a good deal more intimate.
Occasionally they took the form of a quiet
dinner, or a few hours in the little house
near Portland Road; for Florence was rather
a favourite of the editors—perhaps, for one
reason, because she was obviously of opinion
that he ought to be married. A man generally
likes a woman who pays him this
compliment, especially when it is disinterested.
Mr. Fisher was a widower and
childless. There was some story connected
with his marriage, but the Hibberts never
heard the rights of it, and it was evidently a
painful subject to him. All that was known
in the office was that years before a gaunt-looking
woman used to sometimes come for
him, and that they always walked silently
away together. Some one said once that he
had married her because he had known her
for years, and she was poor and he did not
know how to provide for her except by
marrying her, and that she was querulous
and worried him a good deal. After a time
she grew thin and feeble-looking. One day,
about three years after the marriage, her
death appeared in the paper; her husband
looked almost relieved, but very sad, and
no one ventured to ask him any questions.</p>

<p>As Walter walked along the Strand that
morning he meditated on many ways of
improving his condition and at the same
time of not overworking himself. He found
that it told on him considerably to be down
late at the office three nights a week, writing
his article, and then, with the excitement of
work still upon him, to go home tired and
hungry in the small hours of the morning.
It was bad for Florence, too, for she generally
sat up for him, declaring that to taste his
supper and to have a little chat with him did
her good and made her heart light. Sometimes
he thought he would take up a different
line altogether (he knew his editor would aid
and abet him in anything for his good) and
try living in the country, running up to town
every day if necessary. But this would never
do; it would only make him restive. His
position was not yet strong enough to admit
of his taking things so easily. It was important
to him to live among men of knowledge
and influence, to be in the whirl and
twirl of things, and London was essentially
the bull’s-eye, not only of wealth and commerce,
but of most other things with which
men of all degrees concern themselves.</p>

<p>And when he got to this point he came to
the conclusion that he was thinking too much
about himself. After all, he only wanted a
month’s rest or a couple of months’ change of
air; a friendly talk such as he might possibly
get in the next quarter of an hour would
probably bring about one or the other and
in a far better form than he himself could
devise it. Mr. Fisher was a man of infinite
resource, not merely in regard to his paper,
but for himself and his friends too, when they
consulted him about their personal affairs.
It was one of his characteristics that he liked
being consulted. Walter felt that the best
thing would be to get away alone with
Florence, to some place where the climate
had no cause to be ashamed of itself: he
wanted to be sated with sunshine. It was
no good going alone, and no matter how
pleasant a friend went with him, a time
always came when he wanted to go by one
route and the friend by another. “Now,
your wife,” he thought, “not only particularly
longs to go by your route, but thinks you a
genius for finding it out.”</p>

<p>He stopped for a moment to look at a
bookshop; there was a box of second-hand
books outside; he hesitated, but remembered
that he had no time to stay. As he turned
away some one touched him on the arm, and
a voice said doubtfully—</p>

<p>“Will you speak to me, Walter?” He
looked up and instantly held out his hand
with a smile.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s Wimple,” he said; “how are
you, old fellow? Of course I’ll speak to
you. How are you?”</p>

<p>The man who had stopped him was about
eight-and-twenty; he was tall and thin, his
legs were too long and very rickety. To
look at he was not prepossessing; he had a
pinky complexion, pale reddish hair, and
small round dark eyes with light lashes and
weak lids. On either side of his face there
were some straggling whiskers; his lips were
thin and his whole expression very grave.
His voice was low but firm in its tone, as
though he wished to convey that even in
small matters it would be useless to contradict
him. He wore rather shabby dark
clothes, his thin overcoat was unbuttoned
and showed that the undercoat was faced
with watered silk that had worn a little
shiny; attached to his waistcoat was a watchguard
made of brown hair ornamented here
and there with bright gold clasps. He did
not look strong or very flourishing. He
was fairly gentleman-like, but only fairly so,
and he did not look very agreeable. The
apparent weakness of his legs seemed to
prevent him from walking uprightly; he
looked down a good deal at the toes of his
boots, which were well polished. The oddest
thing about him was that with all his unprepossessing
appearance he had a certain
air of sentiment; occasionally a sentimental
tone stole into his voice, but he carefully
repressed it. Walter remembered the
moment he looked at him that the brown
hair watchguard had been the gift of a pretty
girl, the daughter of a tailor to whom he
had made love as if in compensation for not
paying her father’s bill. He wondered how
it had ended, whether the girl had broken
her heart for him, or found him out. But
the next moment he hated himself for his
ungenerous thoughts, and forcing them back
spoke in as friendly a voice as he could
manage. “It’s ages since we came across
each other,” he said, “and I should not have
seen you just now if you had not seen
me.”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t sure whether you would speak
to me,” Mr. Wimple said solemnly, as they
walked on together, and then almost hurriedly,
as if to avoid thinking about unpleasant
things, he asked, “How is your wife?”</p>

<p>“All right, thank you. But how are you,
and how are you getting on?”</p>

<p>“I am not at all well, Walter”—Mr.
Wimple coughed, as if to show that he was
delicate—“and my uncle has behaved shamefully
to me.”</p>

<p>“Why, what has he done?” Walter asked,
wishing that he felt more cordial, for he had
known Alfred Wimple longer almost than
he had known any one. Old acquaintance
was not to be lightly put aside. It constituted
a claim in Walter’s eyes as strong
as did relationship, though it was only when
the claim was made on him, and never when
he might have pressed it for his own advantage,
that he remembered it.</p>

<p>“Done! Why, he has turned me out of his
office, just because he wanted to make room
for the son of a rich client, for nothing else
in the world.”</p>

<p>“That was rough,” Walter answered,
thinking almost against his will that Wimple
had never been very accurate and that this
account was possibly not a fair one. “What
excuse did he make?”</p>

<p>“He said my health was bad, that I was
not strong enough to do the work, and had
better take a few months’ holiday.”</p>

<p>“Well, but that was rather kind of him.”</p>

<p>“He didn’t mean it for kindness;” and
Mr. Wimple looked at his friend with dull
severity in his eyes. “He wanted to give
my place in his office to some one else. But
it is quite true about my health. I am very
delicate, Walter. I must take a few months’
rest.”</p>

<p>“Then perhaps he was right after all.
But can you manage the few months’ rest?”
Walter asked, hesitating, for he knew the
question was expected from him. In old
days he had had so much to do with Wimple’s
affairs that he did not like now to ignore
them altogether.</p>

<p>“He makes me an allowance, of course,
but it’s not sufficient,” Alfred Wimple
answered reluctantly; “I wanted him to
keep my post open for a few months, but
he refused, though he’s the only relation I
have.”</p>

<p>“Well, but he has been pretty good,”
Walter said, in a pacific voice, “and perhaps
he thinks you really want rest. It’s not bad
of him to make you an allowance. It’s more
than any one would do for me if I had to
give up work for a bit.”</p>

<p>“He only does it because he can’t well
refuse, and it’s a beggarly sum, after all.”</p>

<p>To which Walter answered nothing. He
had always felt angry with himself for not
liking Alfred better; they were such very
old friends. They had been school-fellows
long ago, and afterwards, when Walter was
at Cambridge and Alfred was an articled clerk
in London (he was by three years the younger
of the two), there had been occasions when
they had met and spent many pleasant hours
together. To do Walter justice, it had
always been Alfred who had sought him and
not he who had sought Alfred, for in spite of
the latter’s much professed affection Walter
never wholly trusted him; he hated himself
for it, but the fact remained. “The worst
of Alfred is, that he lies,” he had said to
himself long ago. He remembered his own
remark to-day with a certain amount of
reproach, but he knew that he had not been
unjust; still, after all, he thought it was not
so very great a crime: many people lied
nowadays, sometimes merely to give their
conversation an artistic value, and sometimes
without even being aware of it. He was
inclined to think that he had been rather
hard on Alfred, who had been very constant
to him. Besides, Wimple had been unlucky;
he had been left a penniless lad to the care
of an uncle, a rich City solicitor, who had not
appreciated the charge; he had never had a
soul who cared for him, and must have been
very miserable and lonely at times. If he
had had a mother or sister, or any one at all
to look after him, he might have been
different. Then, too, Walter remembered
that once when he was very ill in the vacation
it was Alfred who had turned up and
nursed him with almost a woman’s anxiety.
A kindness like that made a link too strong
for a few disagreeables to break. He could
not help thinking that he was a brute not to
like his old friend better.</p>

<p>“I am sorry things are so bad with you,
old man. You must come and dine and talk
them over.”</p>

<p>Mr. Wimple looked him earnestly in the
face.</p>

<p>“I don’t like to come,” he said in a half-ashamed,
half-pathetic voice; “I behaved
so badly to you about that thirty pounds; but
luck was against me.”</p>

<p>“Never mind, you shall make it all right
when luck is with you,” Walter answered
cheerfully, determined to forget all unpleasant
bygones. “Why not come to-night? we
shall be alone.”</p>

<p>Mr. Wimple shook his head.</p>

<p>“No, not to-night,” he said; “I am not
well, and I am going down to the country
till Wednesday; it will do me good.” A
little smile hovered round his mouth as he
added, “some nice people in Hampshire
have asked me to stay with them.”</p>

<p>“In Hampshire. Whereabouts in Hampshire?”</p>

<p>There was a certain hesitation in Mr.
Wimple’s manner as he answered, “You
don’t know them, and I don’t suppose you
ever heard of the place, Walter; it is called
Liphook.”</p>

<p>“Liphook? Why, of course I know it.
It is on the Portsmouth line; we have a
cottage, left us by my wife’s aunt only last
year, in the same direction, only rather nearer
town. How long are you going to stay
there?”</p>

<p>“Till Wednesday. I will come and dine
with you on Thursday, if you will have me.”</p>

<p>“All right, old man, 7.30. Perhaps you
had better tell me where to write in case I
have to put you off for business reasons.”</p>

<p>Mr. Wimple hesitated a minute, and then
gave his London address, adding that he
should be back on Wednesday night or
Thursday morning at latest. They were
standing by the newspaper office.</p>

<p>“Do you think there might be anything
I could do here?” he asked, nodding at the
poster outside the door; “I might review
legal books or something of that sort.”</p>

<p>“I expect Fisher has a dozen men ready
for anything at a moment’s notice,” Walter
answered, “but I’ll put in a word for you if
I get the chance;” and with a certain feeling
of relief he shook his friend’s hand and
rushed upstairs. The atmosphere seemed
a little clearer when he was alone. “I’ll do
what I can for him,” he thought, “but I
can’t stand much of his company. There is
a want of fresh air about him that bothers
me so. Perhaps he could do a legal book
occasionally, he used to write rather well.
I’ll try what can be done.”</p>

<p>But his talk with Mr. Fisher was so important
to himself and so interesting in many
ways that he forgot all about Alfred until he
was going out of the door; and then it was
too late to speak about him. Suddenly a
happy thought struck him—Mr. Fisher was
to dine with him next week, he would ask
Wimple also for Thursday. Then, if they
got on, the rest would arrange itself. He remembered
too that Alfred always dressed
carefully and looked his best in the evening
and laid himself out to be agreeable.</p>

<p>“By the way, Fisher, I wonder if you
would come on Thursday instead of on
Wednesday. I expect an old friend, and
should like you to meet him; he is clever
and rather off luck just now; of course you’ll
get your chat with my wife all right—in fact,
better if there are one or two people to
engross me.”</p>

<p>“Very well, Thursday if you like; it will
do just as well for me; I am free both evenings
as far as I know.”</p>

<p>“Agreed, then.” And Walter went down
the office stairs pleased at his own success.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p>“That horrid Mr. Wimple will spoil our
dinner; I never liked him,” Florence exclaimed
when she heard of the arrangement.</p>

<p>“I know you didn’t, and I don’t like him
either, which is mean of me, for he’s a very
old friend.”</p>

<p>“But if we neither of us like him, why
should we inflict him on our lives?”</p>

<p>“We won’t; we’ll cut him as soon as he
has five hundred a year; but it wouldn’t be
fair to do so just now when he’s down on his
luck; he and I have been friends too long
for that.”</p>

<p>“But not very great friends?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not; but we won’t throw him
over in bad weather—try and be a little nice
to him to please me, there’s a dear Floggie,”
which instantly carried the day. “You had
better ask Ethel Dunlop; Fisher is fond of
music, and she will amuse him when he is
tired of flirting with you,” Walter suggested.</p>

<p>“He’ll never tire of that,” she laughed,
“but I’ll invite her if you like. She can sing
while you talk to Mr. Wimple and your editor
discusses European politics with me.”</p>

<p>“He’ll probably discuss politics outside
Europe, if he discusses any,” her husband
answered; “things look very queer in the
East.”</p>

<p>“They always do,” she said wisely; “but
I believe it’s all nonsense, and only our idea
because we live so far off.”</p>

<p>“You had better tell Fisher to send me
out to see.”</p>

<p>“Us, you mean.”</p>

<p>“No, me. They wouldn’t stand you,
dear,” and he looked at her anxiously; “I
shouldn’t be much surprised if he asked me
to go for a bit—indeed, I think he has an
idea of it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Walter, it would be horrible.”</p>

<p>“Not if it did me good; sometimes I
think I need a thorough change.”</p>

<p>She looked at him for a moment.</p>

<p>“No, not then,” she answered.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER III.</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><img class='dropcap' src='images/capf.jpg' style='float:left;width:5%;' alt='F'/>lorence</span> sat thinking over Walter’s
hint concerning his health. She had
succeeded in frightening herself a good deal;
for there was really nothing the matter with
him that rest and change would not set right.
She remembered all the years he had been
constantly at work, for even in their holidays
he had taken away something he wanted to
get done, and for the first time she realized
how great the strain must have been upon
him. “He must long for a change,” she
thought, “for a break in his life, an upsetting
of its present programme. The best thing
of all would be a sea voyage. That would
do him a world of good.” She fancied him
on board a P. and O., walking up and down
the long deck, drinking in life and strength.
How vigorous he would grow; how sunburnt
and handsome, and how delightful it
would be to see him return. She hoped
that Mr. Fisher would offer him a special
correspondentship for a time, or something
that would break the routine of his life and
give him the excitement and pleasure that
a spell of rest and complete change would
entail. She would talk to Mr. Fisher herself,
she thought. He always liked arranging
other people’s lives; he was so clever in
setting things right for any one who consulted
him, and so helpful; and no doubt
he had noticed already that Walter was
looking ill.</p>

<p>“But he is quite well; it is nothing but
overwork, and that can soon be set
right——”</p>

<p>There was a double knock at the street
door.</p>

<p>It was only eleven o’clock, too early for
visitors. Florence left off thinking of Walter
to wonder who it could be. The door was
opened and shut, the servant’s footsteps
going up to the drawing-room were followed
by others so soft that they could scarcely be
heard at all.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Baines, ma’am. She told me to say
that she was most anxious to see you.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Baines?” Florence exclaimed
absently. It was so long since she had
seen Aunt Anne, and she had never heard her
called by her formal name, that for the moment
she was puzzled. Then she remembered
and went up quickly to meet her visitor.</p>

<p>Aunt Anne was sitting on the little yellow
couch near the window. She looked thin
and spare, as she had done at Brighton,
but she had a woebegone air now that had
not belonged to her then. She was in deep
mourning; there was a mass of crape on her
bonnet, and a limp cashmere shawl clung about
her shoulders. She rose slowly as Florence
entered, but did not advance a single step.</p>

<p>She stretched out her arms; the black
shawl gave them the appearance of wings;
they made her look, as she stood with her
back to the light, like a large bat. But the
illusion was only momentary, and then the
wan face, the many wrinkles, and the nervous
twitch of the left eye all helped to make an
effect that was pathetic enough.</p>

<p>“Florence,” she said in a tremulous voice,
“I felt that I must see you and Walter again,”
and she folded Mrs. Hibbert to her heart.</p>

<p>“I am very glad to see you, Aunt Anne,”
Florence answered simply. “Are you quite
well, and are you staying in London?—But
you are in deep mourning; I hope you have
not had any very sad loss?”</p>

<p>The tears came into the poor old lady’s
eyes.</p>

<p>“My dear,” she said still more tremulously
than before, “you are evidently not aware
of my great bereavement; but I might have
known that, for if you had been you would
have written to me. Florence, I am a
widow; I am alone in the world.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hibbert put her hands softly on
Aunt Anne’s and kissed her.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know, I had no idea, and Walter
had not——”</p>

<p>“I knew it. Don’t think that I have
wronged either you or him. I knew that
you were ignorant of all that had happened
to me or you would have written to express
your sympathy, though, if you had, I might
not even have received your letter, for I
have been homeless too,” Mrs. Baines said
sadly. She stopped for a moment; then,
watching Florence intently, she went on in
a choking voice, “Mr. Baines has been dead
more than eight months. He died as he
had lived, my darling. He thought of you
both three weeks before his death,” and her
left eye winked.</p>

<p>“It was very kind of him,” Florence said
gratefully; “and you, dear Aunt Anne,”
she asked gently, “are you staying in
London for the present? Where are you
living?”</p>

<p>It seemed as if Aunt Anne gathered up
all her strength to answer.</p>

<p>“My dear, I am in London because I am
destitute—destitute, Florence, and—and I
have to work for my living.”</p>

<p>Her niece was too much astonished to
answer for a minute.</p>

<p>“But, Aunt Anne,” she exclaimed, “how
can you work? what can you have strength
to do, you poor dear?”</p>

<p>Aunt Anne hesitated a moment; she
winked again in an absent unconscious
manner, and then answered with great
solemnity:</p>

<p>“I have accepted a post at South Kensington
as chaperon to a young married lady
whose husband is abroad. She has a
young sister staying with her, and her husband
does not approve of their being
alone without some older person to protect
them.”</p>

<p>“It is very brave of you to go out into
the world now,” Florence said admiringly.</p>

<p>“My dear, it would be most repugnant
to me to be a burden to any one, even to
those who love me best; that is why—why
I did it, Florence.”</p>

<p>“And are they kind to you? do they
treat you quite properly?” Mrs. Hibbert
inquired anxiously.</p>

<p>The old lady drew herself up and answered
severely:</p>

<p>“I should not stay with them an hour
if they ever forgot what was due to me.
They treat me with the greatest respect.”</p>

<p>“But why have you been obliged to do
this, you poor Aunt Anne? Had Mr.
Baines no money to leave you?”</p>

<p>Aunt Anne’s mouth twitched as she heard
the “Mr. Baines,” but Florence had never
thought of him as anything else, and when
the two last words slipped out she felt it
would be better to go on and not to notice
her mistake.</p>

<p>“No, my love, at his death his income
ceased; there was barely enough for immediate
expenses, and then—and then I had
to go out into the world.”</p>

<p>It was terrible to see how keenly Aunt
Anne suffered; how fully alive she was to
the sad side of her own position. Poor old
lady, it was impossible to help feeling very
much for her, Florence thought.</p>

<p>“And had he no relations at all who could
help you, dear?” she asked, wondering that
none should have held out a helping hand.</p>

<p>“No, not one. I married for love, as
you did; that is one reason why I knew
that you would feel for me.”</p>

<p>There was a world of sadness in her voice
as she said the last words; her face seemed
to grow thinner and paler as she related her
troubles. She looked far older, too, than
she had done on the Brighton day. The
little lines about her face had become
wrinkles; her hair was scantier and greyer;
her eyes deeper set in her head; her hands
were the thin dry hands of old age.</p>

<p>Florence ached for her, and pondered
things over for a moment. Walter was not
rich, and he was not strong just now; the
hint of yesterday had sunk deep in her heart.
Still, he and she must try and make this
poor soul’s few remaining years comfortable,
if no one else could be found on whom she
had a claim. She did not think she could
ask Aunt Anne to come and live with
them; she remembered an aunt who had
lived in her girlhood’s home, who had not
been a success. But they might for all that
do something; the old lady could not be
left to the wide world’s tender mercies.
Florence knew but little of her husband’s
relations, except that he had no near or
intimate ones left, but there might be some
outlying cousins sufficiently near to Aunt
Anne to make their helping her a moral
obligation.</p>

<p>“Have you no friends—no relations at all,
dear Aunt Anne?” she asked.</p>

<p>With a long sigh Mrs. Baines answered:</p>

<p>“Florence”—she gave a gulp before she
went on, as if to show that what she had to
tell was almost too sad to be put into words,—“Sir
William Rammage is my own cousin,
he has thousands and thousands a year, and
he refuses to allow me anything. I went to
him when I first came to London and begged
him to give me a small income so that I
might not be obliged to go out into the
world; but he said that he had so many
claims upon him that it was impossible. Yet
he and I were babes together; we lay in the
same cradle once, while our mothers stood
over us, hand in hand. But though we had
not met since we were six years old till I
went to him in my distress a few months
ago, he refused to do anything for me.”</p>

<p>“Have you been in London long then,
Aunt Anne?”</p>

<p>“I have been here five months, Florence.
I took a lodging on the little means I had
left, and then—and then I had to struggle as
best I could.”</p>

<p>“You should have come to us before,
poor dear.”</p>

<p>“I should have done so, my love, but—my
lodging was too simple, and I was not in a
position to receive you as I could have
wished. I waited, hoping that Sir William
would see that it was incumbent on him to
make me an adequate allowance; but he has
not done so.”</p>

<p>“And won’t he do anything for you? If
he is rich he might do something temporarily,
even if he won’t make you a permanent
allowance. Has he done nothing?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Baines shook her head sadly.</p>

<p>“He sent me some port wine, my love,
but port wine is always pernicious to me; I
wrote and told him so, but he did not even
reply. It is not four years ago since he was
Lord Mayor of London, and yet he will do
nothing for me.”</p>

<p>She had lost her air of distress, there was
a dogged dignity in her manner; she stood
up and looked at her niece; it seemed as if,
in speaking of Sir William Rammage, she
remembered that the world had used her
shamefully, and she had determined to give
it back bitter scorn for its indifference to her
griefs.</p>

<p>“Lord Mayor of London,” Mrs. Hibbert
repeated, and rubbed her eyes a little; it
seemed like part of a play and not a very
sane one—the old lady, her deep mourning,
her winking left eye, and the sudden introduction
of a Lord Mayor.</p>

<p>“Yes, Lord Mayor of London,” repeated
Mrs. Baines, “and he lets me work for my
daily bread.”</p>

<p>“Is Walter also related to the Lord
Mayor?”</p>

<p>“No, my love. Your Walter’s grandfather
married twice; I was the daughter of
the first marriage—my mother was the daughter
of a London merchant—your Walter’s
father was the son of the second marriage.”</p>

<p>“It is too complicated to understand,”
Florence answered in despair. “And is
there no one else, Aunt Anne?”</p>

<p>“There are many others, but they are indifferent
as he is, they are cold and hard,
Florence; that is a lesson one has to learn
when fortune deserts one,” and the old lady
shook her head mournfully.</p>

<p>“But, dear Aunt Anne,” Florence said,
aghast at this sudden vista of the world,
“tell me who they are besides Sir William
Rammage; let Walter try what can be done.
Surely they cannot all be as cold and hard as
you think.”</p>

<p>“It is of no use, my love,” Mrs. Baines
said sadly.</p>

<p>“But perhaps you are mistaken, and they
will after all do something for you. Do tell
me who they are.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Baines drew herself up proudly; the
tears that had seemed to be on their way a
minute ago must have retreated suddenly,
for her eyes looked bright, and she spoke in
a quick, determined voice.</p>

<p>“My love,” she said, “you must not expect
me to give you an account of all my
friends and relations and of what they will
or will not do for me. Don’t question me,
my love, for I cannot allow it—I cannot
indeed. I have told you that I am destitute,
that I am a widow, that I am working
for my living; and that must suffice. I am
deeply attached to you and Walter; there
is in my heart a picture that will never be
effaced of you and him standing in our
garden at Rottingdean, of your going away
in the sunshine with flowers and preserve in
your hands—the preserve that I myself had
made. It is because I love you that I have
come to you to-day, and because I feel assured
that you love me; but you must remember, Florence,
that I am your aunt and you must treat
me with proper respect and consideration.”</p>

<p>“But, Aunt Anne——” Florence began
astonished.</p>

<p>Mrs. Baines put her hand on Mrs. Hibbert’s
shoulder.</p>

<p>“There there,” she said forgivingly, “I
know you did not mean to hurt me,
but”—and here her voice grew tender and
tremulous again—“no one, not even you or
Walter, must presume, for I cannot allow it.
There—kiss me,” and she pulled Florence’s
head down on to her breast, while suddenly—for
there were wonderfully quick transitions
of feeling expressed on the old wan face all
through the interview—a smile that was
almost joyous came to her lips. “I am so
glad to see you again, my dear,” she said;
“I have looked forward to this day for years.
I loved you from the very first moment I
saw you at Brighton, and I have always
loved your Walter. I wish,” she went on,
as Florence gently disengaged herself from
the black cashmere embrace, “I wish you
could remember him a little boy as I do.
He had the darkest eyes and the lightest
hair in the world.”</p>

<p>“His hair is a beautiful brown now,” her
niece answered, rather thankfully.</p>

<p>“Yes, my love, it is,” the old lady said,
with a little glee at the young wife’s pride.
“And so is yours. I think you have the
prettiest hair I ever saw.” There was not
a shade of flattery in her voice, so that
Florence was appeased after the severe snub
of a moment ago, and smoothed her plaits
with much complacency. “And now, tell
me when will your dear one be at home, for
I long to see him?”</p>

<p>“He is very uncertain, Aunt Anne; I fear
he has no fixed time; but I know that he will
try and make one to see you when he hears
that you are in town.”</p>

<p>“I am sure he will,” Mrs. Baines said,
evidently certain that there was no doubt at all
about that. “Are the dear children at home?”
she inquired. “I long for a sight of them.”</p>

<p>“Shall I call them?”</p>

<p>“Yes, my love; it will do my heart good
to look at them.”</p>

<p>Nothing loth, Florence opened the door
and called upstairs:</p>

<p>“Monty and Catty, are you there, my
beauties? I want you, my chicks.”</p>

<p>There was a quick patter-patter overhead,
a door opened and two little voices answered
both at once—</p>

<p>“We’ll come, mummy, we’ll come.”</p>

<p>A moment later there entered a sturdy
boy of six, with eyes like his father’s, and
a girl of three and a half, with nut-brown
hair hanging down her back.</p>

<p>“We are come, mummy,” they exclaimed
joyfully, as their mother, taking their fat
hands in hers, led them up to Aunt Anne.
The old lady took them in her arms and
kissed them.</p>

<p>“Bless them,” she said, “bless them. I
should have known them anywhere. They
couldn’t be any one else’s children. My
darlings, do you know me?” Monty drew
back a little way and looked at her saucily,
as if he thought the question rather a joke.</p>

<p>“No, we don’t know you,” he answered
in a jovial voice, “we don’t know you a bit.”</p>

<p>“Bless him,” exclaimed Aunt Anne, and
laughed aloud for glee. “He is so like
his father, it makes me forget all my sorrows
to see him. My dear children,” she went on,
solemnly addressing them, “I did not bring
you anything, but before the day is finished
you shall have proof that Aunt Anne loves
you. Good-bye, my dears, good-bye;” and
she looked at their mother with an expression
that said plainly, “Send them away.”</p>

<p>Florence opened the door and the children
pattered back to the nursery. When they
had gone Mrs. Baines rose.</p>

<p>“I must go too,” she said sadly, as if she
had overtaken her griefs and sorrows again,
“for I am no longer my own mistress. Remember
that, dear, when you think of me, or
when you and Walter converse together.”</p>

<p>“But it is nearly one o’clock, will not you
stay and lunch? Walter might come, and
he would be so glad to see you,” Florence
said anxiously, remembering that as yet she
had done nothing to help the old lady, and
without her husband she felt it was too
awkward a task to attempt.</p>

<p>“No, my dear, no; but I shall come again
when you least expect me, on the chance
of finding you at home.”</p>

<p>“And is there nothing I can do for you,
Aunt Anne?” Florence asked hesitatingly,
“no way in which I can be useful to you?”</p>

<p>“No, my dear, no; but thank you and
bless you for your tender heart. There is
nothing I want. I wish you could see Mrs.
North, Florence, she is kindness itself. I
have been in the house five weeks, and they
have never once failed to show me the
attention that is due to me,” she said, with
grave dignity. “We went to Covent Garden
Theatre last night—I refused to go to Drury
Lane, for I did not approve of the name of
the piece—they insisted on giving me the
best place, and were most anxious when we
reached home for fear I had taken cold
whilst waiting for the carriage.”</p>

<p>It seemed as if Aunt Anne had been
extraordinarily lucky.</p>

<p>“And you like being with young people,
I think,” Florence said, noticing how her
sad face lighted up while she spoke of the
theatre.</p>

<p>“It is always a pleasure to me to witness
happiness in others,” Aunt Anne answered,
with a long benevolent sigh, “and it is a
comfort to know that to this beautiful girl—for
Mrs. North is only four-and-twenty, my
dear—my presence is beneficial and my
experience of life useful. I wish you would
come and call on her.”</p>

<p>“But she might not like it? I don’t see
why she should desire my acquaintance.”</p>

<p>“She would think it the greatest honour
to know anybody belonging to me.”</p>

<p>“Is she an old friend, Aunt Anne, or how
did you know her?” Florence asked, wondering
at the great kindness extended to the
old lady, and whether there was a deep
foundation for it. She did not think it
likely, from all that she had heard, that
companions were generally treated with so
much consideration. For a moment Aunt
Anne was silent, then she answered coldly—</p>

<p>“I met her through an advertisement.
But you must not question me, you must not
indeed, Florence; I never allowed any one
to do that, and I am too old to begin; too
old and feeble and worn out to allow it even
from you, my love.”</p>

<p>“But, dear Aunt Anne, I did not mean
to hurt or offend you in any way. I merely
wondered, since these people were so kind
to you, if they were new or old friends,”
Florence said affectionately, but still a little
stiffly, for now that she had been assured
the old lady was so well provided for, she
felt that she might defend herself.</p>

<p>“Then you must forgive me,” Mrs. Baines
said penitently; “I know I am foolishly
sensitive sometimes, but in my heart I shall
never misjudge you or Walter; be assured
of that, my darling.”</p>

<p>She went slowly up to a little ebony-framed
looking-glass that was over a bracket
in an out-of-the-way corner—it was odd that
she should even have noticed it—and stood
before it arranging her bonnet, till she was
a mass of blackness and woe. “My love,”
she said, “would you permit your servant
to call a cab for me? I prefer a hansom. I
promised Mrs. North that I would return
to luncheon, and I fear that I am already
a little behindhand.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but hansoms are so expensive, and
I have been the cause——” Florence began
as she put her hand on the bell.</p>

<p>“I must beg you not to mention it. I
would spend my last penny on you and
Walter, you know I would.” Mrs. Baines
answered with the manner that had carried
all before it at Brighton. It brought back
to Florence’s memory her own helplessness
and Walter’s on that morning which had
ended in the carrying away of jam and yellow
flowers from Rottingdean. She went downstairs
with the old lady and opened the door.
Mrs. Baines looked at the hansom and
winked. “It is a curious thing, my dear
Florence,” she said, “but ever since I can
remember I have had a marked repugnance
to a grey horse.”</p>

<p>“Shall we send it away and get another?”</p>

<p>“No, my dear, no; I think it foolish to
encourage a prejudice: nothing would induce
me now not to go by that cab.”</p>

<p>She gathered her shawl close round her
shoulders and went slowly down the steps;
when she was safely in the hansom and the
door closed in front of her, she bowed with
dignity to Florence, as if from the private
box of a theatre.</p>

<p>That same afternoon there arrived a pot
of maidenhair fern with a card attached to it
on which was written, <span class='it'>Mrs. Walter Hibbert,
from Aunt Anne</span>, and two smaller pots of
bright flowers <span class='it'>For the dear children</span>.</p>

<p>“How very kind of her,” exclaimed
Florence; “but she ought not to spend her
money on us—the money she earns too. Oh,
she is much too generous.”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear,” Walter said to Florence; and
Florence thought that his voice was a little odd.</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><h1>CHAPTER IV.</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><img class='dropcap' src='images/capi2.jpg' style='float:left;width:5%;' alt=' “I'/> WISH</span> we could do something for
Aunt Anne,” Mrs. Hibbert said to
her husband that evening. “It was very
kind of her to send us those flowers.”</p>

<p>“Let’s ask her to dine.”</p>

<p>“Of course we will—she is longing to see
you; still, asking her to dine will not be
doing anything for her.”</p>

<p>“But it will please her very much; she
likes being treated with respect,” Walter
laughed. “Let’s send her a formal invitation.
You see these people she is with evidently
like her and may give her a hundred or two
a year, quite as much as she wants, so that
all we can do is to show her some attention.
Therefore, I repeat, let’s ask her to dine.”</p>

<p>“It’s so like a man’s suggestion,” Florence
exclaimed; “but still, we’ll do it if you like.
She wants to see you. Of course she may
not be able to come if her time is not her
own.”</p>

<p>“We must risk that—I’ll tell you what,
Floggie dear, ask her for next Thursday, with
Fisher and Wimple and Ethel Dunlop.
She’ll make the number up to six, which
will be better than five. It will please her
enormously to be asked to meet people—in
your invitation say a small dinner-party.”</p>

<p>“Very well. It will be a comfort if she
takes Mr. Wimple off our hands. Perhaps
she will.”</p>

<p>So a quite formal invitation was sent to
Aunt Anne, and her reply awaited with much
anxiety. It came the next morning, and
ran thus:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“<span class='sc'>My dear Florence</span>,</p>

<p>“It gives me sincere pleasure to
accept the invitation that you and your dear
Walter have sent me for next Thursday.
It is long since I went into society, except
in this house, where it is a matter of duty.
But, for your sakes, dears, I will put aside
my sorrow for the evening, and try to enjoy,
as I ought, the pleasure of seeing you both,
and of meeting those whom you honour with
your friendship.</p>

<p>“In the happiness and excitement of seeing
you the other day, dear Florence, I forgot
to mention one object of my visit. It is
most important to me in my present unfortunate
position to hide my poverty and
to preserve an appearance that will prevent
me from being slighted in the society in
which—sorely against my will—I am thrown.
Will you, therefore, my dear ones, send me
a black satin sunshade, plain but good, lined
with black in preference to white, and with
a handle sufficiently distinctive to prevent
its being mistaken for another person’s if it
is left in the hall when I am paying visits?
There are many other things I require, but
I do not like to tax your kindness too far,
or, knowing your generous hearts, to cause
you disquiet even by naming them. At the
same time, dear Florence, I am sure you
will understand my embarrassment when I
tell you I only possess four pocket-handkerchiefs
fit to use in a house like this. If you
have any lying by you with a deep black
border, and would lend them to me till you
require them, it would be a real boon.</p>

<p>“Kiss your sweet children for me. I
sent them yesterday a little token that I did
not cease to think of you all as soon as I had
left your presence—as the world is only too
prone to do.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:5em;'>“Your affectionate Aunt,</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;'>“<span class='sc'>Anne Baines</span>.</p>

<p>“P.S.—I should be glad, my darlings, to
have the sunshade without delay, for the
afternoons are getting to be so bright and
sunny that I have requested Mrs. North to
have out the open carriage for her afternoon
drive.”</p>

</div>

<p>“Really, Walter,” Mrs. Hibbert said, “she
is a most extraordinary person. If she is
so poor that she cannot buy a few pocket-handkerchiefs,
why did she send us those
presents yesterday? Flowers are expensive
at this time of year.”</p>

<p>“It was very like her. I remember years
ago hearing that she had quarrelled with
my uncle Tom because she sent his son a
wedding present, and then he would not lend
her the money to pay the bill.”</p>

<p>“Of course we will send her the things,
but she is a foolish old lady. As if I should
keep deep black-bordered handkerchiefs by
me: really it is too absurd.”</p>

<p>“Yes, darling, it is too absurd. Still, send
her a nice sunshade, or whatever it is she
wants; I suppose a pound or two will do it,”
Walter said, and hurried off to the office.</p>

<p>But Florence sat thinking. The sunshade
and the handkerchiefs would make a big hole
in the money allowed for weekly expenses,
could not indeed come out of it. She wished
she could take things as easily as Walter
did, but the small worries of life never fell
upon him as they did upon her. She was
inclined to think that it was the small worries
that made wrinkles, and she thought of those
on poor Aunt Anne’s face. Perhaps that
was why women as a rule had so many more
lines than men. The lines on a man’s face
were generally fewer and deeper, but on a
woman’s they were small and everywhere;
they symbolized the little cares of every day,
the petty anxieties that found men too hard
to mark. She went through her accounts:
she was one of those women who keep them
carefully, who know to a penny how they
spent their last five-pound note. But it was
only because she was anxious to give Walter
the very best that could be got out of his
income that she measured so often the length
and breadth of her purse. However, it was
no good. The old lady must have her sunshade
and her handkerchiefs. So Florence
walked to Regent Street and back to buy
them. She went without the gloves she
had promised herself, determined that Catty
should wait for a hat, and that she would
cut down the dessert for a week at the
little evening dinner.</p>

<p>The brown-paper parcel was directed and
sent off to Mrs. Baines. With a sigh
Florence wished she were more generous,
and dismissed the whole business from her
mind.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Baines called, ma’am,” the servant
said, when she reached home that day.
“She wanted the address of a very good
dressmaker.”</p>

<p>“Is she here? I hope you begged her
to come in?” Florence asked, with a vision
of Aunt Anne calling in a hurry, tired by
her walk, and distressed at finding no one
at home.</p>

<p>“Oh no, ma’am; she didn’t get out of the
carriage when she heard you were not in.
I gave her Madame Celestine’s address, and
said that she had made your best evening
dress, as she was very particular about its
being a grand dressmaker.”</p>

<p>“I suppose it was for Mrs. North,”
Florence thought. “Poor Aunt Anne is
not likely to want Madame Celestine.”</p>

<p>Then she imagined the spare old lady in
a scanty black gown going out with the
pretty and probably beautifully dressed girls
to whom she was chaperon.</p>

<p>As a sort of amends for the unkindness
of fate, Florence made some little soft white
adornments for throat and wrists such as
widows wear and that yet look smart, and,
packing them in a cardboard box, sent them—<span class='it'>With
kind love to Aunt Anne</span>. “Perhaps
they will gratify her pride a little, poor
dear, and it is so nice to have one’s pride
gratified,” she thought. And then, for a
space, Aunt Anne was almost forgotten.</p>

<p>The days slipped by anxiously enough to
the Hibberts—to Walter, for he knew that
Mr. Fisher meant to talk with Florence
about something that had been agreed between
them at the office; to Florence,
because without increasing the bills she
really could not manage to put that little
dinner together. Walter was particular; he
liked luxuries, and things well managed, and
she could not bear to disappoint him.
However, the evening came at last. The
flowers and dessert were arranged, the claret
was at the right temperature, the champagne
was in ice. Florence went upstairs to say
good-night to the children, and to rest for
five minutes. Walter came in with a flower
for her dress.</p>

<p>“It is so like you,” she said as she kissed
it; “you are always the thoughtfullest old
man in the world.”</p>

<p>“I wished I had bought one for Aunt
Anne as I came along in the hansom; but
I forgot it at first, and then I was afraid to
go back because it was getting so late.”</p>

<p>He dressed and went downstairs. Florence
leisurely began to get ready. Ten
minutes later a carriage stopped; a bell
rang, there was a loud double knock—some
one had arrived.</p>

<p>“But it is a quarter of an hour too soon?”
she said in dismay to Maria who was helping
her.</p>

<p>The maid stood on tiptoe by the window
to see who the early comer might be.</p>

<p>“It’s only Mrs. Baines, ma’am.”</p>

<p>They had learned to say “only” already,
Florence thought. She was angry at the
word, yet relieved at its not being a more
important visitor.</p>

<p>“I am very vexed at not being dressed
to receive her,” she said coldly, in order to
give Mrs. Baines importance. “Make
haste and fasten my dress, Maria.”</p>

<p>There was a sound of some one coming
upstairs, a rustle of silk, and a gentle knock
at the bedroom door.</p>

<p>“My darling, I came early on purpose.
May I be allowed to enter, dear Florence?”</p>

<p>The voice was certainly Aunt Anne’s, but
the tone was so joyous, so different from the
woebegone one of ten days ago that it filled
her hearer with amazement.</p>

<p>“Come in, Aunt Anne, if you like; but I
am not quite ready.”</p>

<p>“I know that, my love. I hoped you
would not be;” and Aunt Anne entered,
beaming with satisfaction, beautifully dressed,
her long robe trailing, her thin throat
wrapped with softest white of some filmy
kind, her shoes fastened with heavy bows
that showed a paste diamond in them, her
hands full of flowers. Florence could scarcely
believe her eyes.</p>

<p>“Aunt Anne!” she exclaimed, and stood
still looking at her.</p>

<p>“Yes, my love,” the old lady laughed.
“Aunt Anne; and she has brought you
these flowers. I thought they might adorn
your room, and that they would prove how
much you were in my mind, even while I
was away from you. Would you gratify me
by wearing one or two? I see you have
a white rose there, but I am sure Walter
will not mind your wearing one of his aunt’s
flowers; and, my love, perhaps you will
permit your maid to take the rest downstairs
to arrange before the arrival of your other
guests. I will myself help you to finish
your toilette.”</p>

<p>With an air that was a command, she
gave the flowers to Maria and carefully
watched her out of the room. Then turning
to Florence, she asked with the joyousness
still in her manner, “And now, my dear,
tell me if you like my dress?”</p>

<p>“It is quite beautiful, and so handsome.”</p>

<p>“My darling, I am thankful to hear you
say that, for I bought it to do you honour.
I was touched to get your invitation, and
determined that you should not be ashamed
of me. Did the housemaid tell you that
she gave me Madame Celestine’s address?”</p>

<p>“Yes. But, Aunt Anne, I hope you
bargained with her. She costs a fortune if
you don’t.”</p>

<p>“Never mind what she costs. I wished
to prove to you both how much I loved you
and desired to do you honour. And now,
my dear, I perceive that you are ready, let
us go down. I have not seen Walter yet,
and am longing to put my arms round his
dear neck before any one else arrives and
forces me into a formality that my heart
would resent.”</p>

<p>She turned and led the way downstairs.
Florence followed meekly, feeling almost
shabby and altogether left in the shade by
the magnificent relation who had appeared
for their simple party.</p>

<p>Aunt Anne trod with the footstep of one
who knew the house well; she opened the
drawing-room door with an air of precision,
and going towards Walter, who met her
halfway across the room, dropped her head
with its white cap on his shoulder.</p>

<p>“My dear Walter, no words can express
how glad I am to see you again, to meet
you in your own house, in your own room.
It makes me forget all I have suffered since
we parted; it even forces me to be gay,”
she murmured, in an almost sobbing tone.</p>

<p>“Yes, dear, of course it does,” he said
cheerily, giving her a kiss. “And we are
very glad to see you. Why, you look
uncommonly well; and, I say, what an awful
swell you are—isn’t she, Floggie?”</p>

<p>“He is precisely the same—the same as
ever,” laughed out the old lady just as she
had at Brighton seven years before. “Precisely
the same. Oh, my dear Walter, I
shall——”</p>

<p>But here the door opened, and for the
moment Mr. Wimple’s arrival put an end
to Aunt Anne’s remembrances.</p>

<p>Mr. Wimple was evidently conscious of
his evening clothes; his waistcoat was cut
so as to show as much white shirt as
possible; his tie looked a little rumpled,
as though the first attempt at making a bow
had not been successful. He shook hands
solemnly with his host and hostess, then
looked round almost sadly, and in a voice
that was full of grave meaning said it was
cold and chilly.</p>

<p>“Cough better?” Walter inquired.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is better,” Mr. Wimple replied
slowly after a moment’s consideration, as if
the question was a momentous one.</p>

<p>“That’s right. Now, I must introduce
you to my aunt, Mrs. Baines. Alfred
Wimple is an old schoolfellow of mine, Aunt
Anne.”</p>

<p>The old lady put out her gloved hand
with the lace ruffle round the wrist.</p>

<p>“I am glad to meet you,” she said. “It
is always a pleasure to me to meet any one
who has been intimately associated with my
dear Walter.”</p>

<p>“And to me to meet any one belonging
to him,” Mr. Wimple responded, with much
gravity. “Walter is the oldest, and I may
say the dearest, friend I possess.”</p>

<p>“It makes us also friends;” and Aunt
Anne gave him a little gracious smile.</p>

<p>He looked up at her.</p>

<p>“It would be impossible that any one
loving my dear Walter should not possess
my friendship,” she said as if explaining her
previous speech: she made it appear almost
a condescension. He looked at her again,
but more attentively.</p>

<p>“I am very fond of Walter,” he said.</p>

<p>“It is impossible to help it—dear boy,” she
said under her breath as she looked at her
nephew. “It must be a great pleasure to
him, Mr. Wimple, to preserve your affection;
the feelings of our youth are so often lost in
oblivion as we grow old—as we grow older
I should say, in speaking to you.”</p>

<p>The other guests entered, Ethel Dunlop
a little shy but smiling, as if aware that
being a girl she had more business at dances
than at dinner-parties, but was nevertheless
quite happy. And lastly Mr. Fisher. Alfred
Wimple stood on one side till Walter went
towards him.</p>

<p>“Fisher, this is a very old friend of mine.
I want to introduce him to you.”</p>

<p>There was something irritating and savouring
of mock humility in Mr. Wimple’s manner
as he bowed and said, with a little gulp that
was one of his peculiarities—</p>

<p>“Walter is always conferring benefits
upon me—this is a great honour.”</p>

<p>Mr. Fisher looked at him and, with a
polite word, turned to Ethel Dunlop. She
was busy with her glove.</p>

<p>“Buttons always come off,” she said, without
looking up. Other people might treat
him with deference as an editor; to her he
was a mere man.</p>

<p>“But you can at least sew them on; my
sex is not so accomplished.”</p>

<p>She seemed to be thinking of something
else and did not answer, and a puzzled look
came over his face, as if a girl was a
problem he did not know how to work out.
He was an odd looking man, tall and pale,
with a quantity of light hair pushed back
from his high forehead. He had almost
tender blue eyes; but there was something
hard and firm about the mouth and
square jaw that gave his face a look of
strength. He was not a young man, but it
was difficult to believe that he had ever been
younger or would be older; he seemed to
have been born for middle age, and the direction
of people and affairs. The awkwardness
of middle age that is not accustomed to
womankind overtook him as he stood by
Ethel. It was a little relief to him when
dinner was announced.</p>

<p>Aunt Anne turned to Walter, as he
went up to her, with a little inclination
of her head and a smile of dignified happiness.</p>

<p>“It is so like a dream to be here with
you, to be going down on your arm—dear
children,” she whispered as they descended
the narrow staircase.</p>

<p>Looking back, Florence always felt that
Aunt Anne had been the heroine of that
party. She took the lead in conversation,
the others waiting for her to speak, and no
one dared to break up the group at table
into <span class='it'>tête-à-tête</span> talk. She was so bright and
full of life and had so much to say that she
carried all before her. Ethel Dunlop, young
and pretty, felt piqued; usually Mr. Fisher
was attentive to her, to-night he talked
entirely to Mrs. Baines. That horrid Mr.
Wimple, as she called him in her thoughts,
had been quite attentive when she met him
before, but now he too kept his eyes fixed on
the old lady opposite; but for her host she
would have felt neglected. And it was odd
how well Aunt Anne managed to flirt with
everybody.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Baines has given me some useful
hints about birds,” Mr. Fisher told
Florence with a suspicion of amusement in
his voice: “if I had been as wise formerly
as she has made me to-night the white
cockatoo might have been living still. We
ought to have met years ago, Mrs. Baines,”
he said, turning to her.</p>

<p>“I think so too,” she said winningly. “It
is such a pleasure to meet dear Walter’s and
Florence’s friends,” she added, looking round
the table and giving a strange little wink at
the last word that made Mr. Wimple feel
almost uncomfortable. “It is a privilege
that I have looked forward to for years, but
that living in the country has hitherto made
impossible. Now that I am in London I
hope I shall meet them all in turn.” Then
she lowered her voice and went on to the
editor: “I have heard so much of you, Mr.
Fisher, if you will forgive me for saying so,
though a great career like yours implies that
all the world has heard of you.”</p>

<p>“I wish it could be called a great career,
my dear lady,” he answered, feeling that she
was a person whose death would deserve a
paragraph simply on account of the extraordinary
knowledge of the world she possessed.
“Unfortunately it has been a very ordinary
one, but I can assure you that I am most
glad to meet you to-night. I ought to have
been at a City dinner, and shall always
congratulate myself on my happier condition.”</p>

<p>“I should like to see a City dinner,” Mrs.
Baines said sadly.</p>

<p>“I wish I could send you my invitations.
I go to too many, I fear.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you have been to a great many
also, Mr. Wimple?” Aunt Anne inquired,
careful to exclude no one from her little
court.</p>

<p>“To one only, I regret to say, Mrs.
Baines,” Mr. Wimple answered solemnly;
“four years ago I went to the solitary one
I ever attended.”</p>

<p>“Ah, that was during the mayoralty of Sir
William Rammage.”</p>

<p>“Do you know him, Mrs. Baines, or do
you keep a record of the Lord Mayors?”
Mr. Fisher asked.</p>

<p>“I knew him well, years and years—I am
afraid I should shock you—you are all so
young—if I said how many years ago,” she
answered; and Mr. Fisher, who was well on
in his forties, thought she was really a charming
old lady.</p>

<p>“He is a great friend of my uncle’s, he is
a very old client of his,” Mr. Wimple said,
looking at Mrs. Baines again with his strange
fixed gaze, while Ethel Dunlop thought that
that horrid Mr. Wimple was actually making
eyes at the old lady as he did at every one
else.</p>

<p>“And may I ask if you also are on
intimate terms with him?” Mrs. Baines
said.</p>

<p>“No, I have only met him at my uncle’s.
He is very rich,” he added, with a sigh,
“and rich people are not much in my way.
Literary people and out-at-elbow scribblers
are my usual associates; for,” he went on,
remembering that there was a possibility of
doing some business with Mr. Fisher, and
that he had better make an impression on
the great man, “I never met any illustrious
members of the profession till to-night, excepting
our friend Walter of course.”</p>

<p>Mr. Fisher looked a little disgusted and
turned to the young lady of the party.</p>

<p>“Have you been very musical lately, Miss
Dunlop?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“No,” she answered, “not very. But we
enjoyed the concert. It was very kind of
you to send the tickets.”</p>

<p>The editor’s face lighted up.</p>

<p>“I am glad,” he said; “and did you find
a pleasant chaperon?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, thank you. I went with my
cousin, George Dighton.”</p>

<p>“Is that the good-looking youth I saw
you with once?”</p>

<p>“Youth,” Ethel laughed; “he is three-and-twenty.”</p>

<p>“A most mature age,” and a smile flickered
over Mr. Fisher’s grave face; “and does he
often escort you to concerts?”</p>

<p>“Occasionally.”</p>

<p>“He is fortunate in having the privilege
as well as the time to avail himself of it,” the
editor said formally. His manner was always
reserved, sometimes even a little stately.
Now and then, oddly enough, it reminded
one of Aunt Anne’s, though it was a generation
younger, and he had not her faculty for
long words.</p>

<p>“You never seem able to go to concerts. It
is quite sad and wicked,” Ethel said brightly.</p>

<p>He looked up as if he liked her.</p>

<p>“Not often. Perhaps some day if you
would honour me, only I am not a cousin;
still I have passed the giddy age of Mr.
Dighton.”</p>

<p>“We will, we will,” she laughed, and
nodded; “but relations only are able to
survive the responsibility of taking me about
alone. Perhaps Mrs. Hibbert would——”</p>

<p>“Ah yes, Mr. Wimple,” they heard Mrs.
Baines say, “I have good reason to know
Sir William Rammage. He is my own
cousin, though for years and years we had
not met till we did so a few months since,
when I came to take up my residence in
London.”</p>

<p>The old lady’s mouth twitched nervously,
the sad note of a week ago made itself heard
in her voice again. Mrs. Hibbert knew that
she was thinking of the unsuccessful appeal
to her rich relation, and of the port wine that
had always proved pernicious to her digestion.</p>

<p>“Your cousin!” said Mr. Wimple, and he
fixed another long, steady gaze upon Mrs.
Baines, “that is very interesting;” and he
was silent.</p>

<p>“Cousins seem to abound in our conversation
this evening,” Miss Dunlop said to Mr.
Fisher; “it must be terrible to be cousin to
the Lord Mayor.”</p>

<p>“Like being related to Gog and Magog,”
he whispered.</p>

<p>“Even worse,” she answered, pretending
to shudder.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Hibbert was looking at Aunt
Anne, for it was time to go upstairs. Mrs.
Baines went out of the door with a stateliness
that was downright courage, considering how
small and slight she was. Ethel Dunlop,
standing aside to let her pass, looked at her
admiringly, but the old lady gave her back,
with the left eye, a momentary glance that
was merely condescending. Unless Aunt
Anne took a fancy to people, or made a
point of being agreeable, she was apt to be
condescending. Her manner to young people
was sometimes impatient, and to servants it
was generally irritating. She had taken a
dislike to Miss Dunlop—she considered her
forward. She did not like the manner in
which she did her hair. She was of opinion
that her dress was unbecoming. All these
things had determined Mrs. Baines to snub
Miss Dunlop, who ill deserved it, for she was
a pretty, motherless girl of one-and-twenty,
very anxious to do right and to find the
world a pleasant dwelling-place.</p>

<p>The old lady sat down on the yellow couch
in the drawing-room again, the same couch
on which, a fortnight before, she had sat and
related her misfortunes. But it was difficult
to believe that she was the same person.
Her dress was spread out; her gloves were
drawn on and carefully buttoned; she opened
and shut a small black fan; she looked round
the drawing-room with an air of condescension,
and almost sternly refused coffee with
a “not any, I thank you,” that made the
servant feel rebuked for having offered it.
Mrs. Hibbert and Ethel felt that she was
indeed mistress of the situation.</p>

<p>“You are musical, I think, Miss Dunlop,”
she asked coldly.</p>

<p>“I am very fond of music, and I play and
sing in a very small way,” was the modest
answer.</p>

<p>“I hope we shall hear you presently,”
Mrs. Baines said grandly, and then, evidently
feeling that she had taken quite enough
notice of Miss Dunlop, she turned to her
niece.</p>

<p>“My dear Florence,” she said, “I think
Mr. Wimple is charming. He has one of
the most expressive countenances I ever
beheld.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mrs. Baines, do you really think
so?” Ethel Dunlop exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Certainly I do.” And Mrs. Baines turned
her back. “Florence, are not you of my
opinion?”</p>

<p>“Well, Aunt Anne, I hardly know——”
And happily the entrance of the men prevented
any further discussion. Somehow
conversation flagged a little, and silence
threatened to fall on the party. Florence
felt uneasy.</p>

<p>“Are we to have some music?” Walter
asked presently. In these days music after
dinner, unless it is very excellent or there
is some special reason for introducing it, is
generally a flag of distress, a sign that dulness
is near. Florence knew it, and looking at
Ethel tried to cover it by asking for a
song.</p>

<p>“Ethel sings German songs delightfully,
Aunt Anne,” she said; “I think you would
enjoy listening to her.”</p>

<p>“I should enjoy listening to any friend
of yours,” the old lady answered. But
Miss Dunlop pleaded hoarseness and did
not stir.</p>

<p>Mr. Wimple roused himself a little. “I
am sure Mrs. Baines plays,” he said, standing
before her. Aunt Anne gave a long sigh.</p>

<p>“My playing days are over,” she answered.</p>

<p>“Oh no, Aunt Anne,” laughed Walter, “we
cannot allow you to make that excuse.”</p>

<p>In a moment she had risen.</p>

<p>“I never make excuses, Walter,” she said
proudly; “if it is your wish—if it will give
you pleasure I will touch the keys again,
though it is long since I brought myself even
to sit down before an instrument.”</p>

<p>She took her place at the piano; she
pulled out her handkerchief, not one of the
black-bordered ones that Florence had sent
her a week ago, but a dainty one of lawn and
lace, and held it for a moment to her forehead;
then suddenly, with a strange vibrating
touch that almost startled her listeners, she
began to play “Oft in the stilly night.” Only
for a moment did the fire last, her fingers
grew feeble, they missed the notes, she shook
her head dreamily.</p>

<p>“I forget—I forget them all,” she said to
herself rather than to any one else, and then
quickly recovering she looked round and
apologized. “It is so long,” she said, “and
I forget.”</p>

<p>She began softly some variations on “I
know a bank,” and played them through to
the end. When they were finished she rose
and, with a little old-fashioned bow to the
piano, turned to Florence, and, saying, with
a sweet and curious dignity, “Thank you,
my dear, and your friends too, for listening
to me,” went back to her seat.</p>

<p>Mr. Wimple was near her chair, he bent
down to her.</p>

<p>“You gave us a great treat,” he said, as if
he were stating a scientific fact.</p>

<p>Mrs. Baines listened to his words gravely,
she seemed to revolve them in her mind for
a moment before she looked up.</p>

<p>“I am sure you are musical, Mr. Wimple,”
she said, “I can see it in your face.”</p>

<p>“Aunt Anne,” Walter said, passing her,
“should you mind my opening this window?”</p>

<p>“No, my darling, I should like it,” she
answered tenderly.</p>

<p>Mr. Wimple gave a long sigh.</p>

<p>“Lucky beggar he is; you are very fond
of him?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes,” she answered, “he is like my
own son;” and she nodded at Walter, who
was carrying on a laughing conversation
with Ethel Dunlop, while his wife was having
what seemed to be a serious one with Mr.
Fisher. She looked round the room, her
gaze rested on the open window. “I think
the carriage must be waiting,” she said,
almost to herself.</p>

<p>“I will tell you;” and Mr. Wimple went
on to the balcony. “It is a lovely night,
Mrs. Baines,” he said, and turning back he
fastened his strange eyes upon her. Without
a word she rose and followed him.</p>

<p>“Aunt Anne,” Florence said, “you will
catch your death of cold; you mustn’t go
out. Walter dear, get my thick white shawl
for Aunt Anne.”</p>

<p>“Oh no, my love, pray continue your
conversation; I have always made a point
of looking up at the sky before I retire
to rest, therefore it is not likely to do me
harm.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t let it do you harm for the
world,” Mr. Wimple whispered.</p>

<p>She heard him; but she seemed to digest
his words slowly, for she nodded to herself
before, with the manner and smile that were
so entirely her own, she answered—</p>

<p>“Pray don’t distress yourself, Mr. Wimple,
I am accustomed to stand before the elements
at all seasons of the year, and this air is not
likely to be detrimental to me; besides,” she
added, with a gentle laugh, “perhaps though
I boasted of my age just now I am not so
old as I look. Oh, dear Walter, you are too
good to me—dear boy;” and she turned and
let him wrap the thick white shawl about her.
He lingered for a moment, but there fell the
dead silence that sometimes seems to chase
away a third person, and, feeling that he
was not wanted, he went back to Ethel
Dunlop. It was a good thing Aunt Anne
liked Alfred, he thought. He had been
afraid the latter would not wholly enjoy his
evening, but the old lady seemed to be
making up for Florence’s rather scanty
attentions.</p>

<p>“It is impossible to you to be old,” Mr.
Wimple said, still speaking almost in a
whisper.</p>

<p>The old lady appeared not to hear him;
her hands were holding the white shawl close
round her neck, her eyes were following the
long row of street lamps on the right. The
horses, waiting with the carriage before the
house, moved restlessly, and made their
harness clink in the stillness. Far off, a
cornet was playing, as cornets love to do,
“Then you’ll remember me.” Beside her
stood the young man watching. Behind,
in the drawing-room, dimly lighted by the
shaded lamp and candles, the others were
talking, forgetful of everything but the subject
that interested them. Cheap sentimental
surrounding enough, but they all told on the
old lady standing out on the balcony. The
stars looking down on her lighted up the soft
white about her throat, and the outline of the
shawl-wrapped shoulders, almost youthful in
their slenderness. Mr. Wimple went a little
closer, the tears came into her eyes, they
trickled down her withered cheeks, but he
did not know it.</p>

<p>“It is like years ago,” she whispered,
“those dear children and all—all—it carries
me back to forty—more—eight-and-forty
years ago, when I was a girl, and now I
am old, I am old, it is the end of the world
for me.”</p>

<p>He stooped and picked up the handkerchief
with the lace border.</p>

<p>“No,” he said, “don’t say that. It is not
the end; age is not counted by years, it is
counted by other things;” and he coughed
uneasily and waited as if to watch the effect
of his speech before continuing. “In reality,”
he went on, in the hard voice that would have
jarred horribly on more sensitive nerves—“in
reality I am older than you, for I have
found the world so much colder than you can
have done.” He said it with deliberation,
as if each word were weighed, or had been
learnt beforehand. “I wish you would teach
me to live out of the abundance of youth
that will always be yours.”</p>

<p>She listened attentively; she turned and
looked towards her left, far ahead, away into
the distance, as if puzzled and fascinated by
it, almost as if she were afraid of the darkness
to which the distance reached. Then
she gave a little nod, as if she had remembered
that it was only the trees of the
Regent’s Park that made the blackness.</p>

<p>“If you would teach me to live out of the
abundance of youth that will always be yours,”
he said again, as if on consideration he were
well satisfied with the sentence, and thought
it merited a reply.</p>

<p>She listened attentively for the second
time, and looked up half puzzled—</p>

<p>“I should esteem myself most fortunate,
if I could be of use to any friend of
Walter’s,” she answered, with an almost
sad formality.</p>

<p>“You have so many who love you——”
The voice was still hard and grating.</p>

<p>“No,” she said, “oh no——”</p>

<p>“There is Sir William Rammage.” He
spoke slowly.</p>

<p>“Ah!” she said sadly, “he forgets. And
old association has no effect upon him.”</p>

<p>“Has he any brothers and sisters?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“They are gone. They all died years
and years ago.”</p>

<p>“It is remarkable that he never married.”</p>

<p>“I suppose his inclinations did not prompt
him to do so.”</p>

<p>“He seems to have no one belonging to
him.”</p>

<p>“There are hardly any left,” she answered,
with a sigh, “and unhappily he does not
appreciate the companionship of those——”</p>

<p>“Aunt Anne, dear Aunt Anne,” Florence
said, “do come in, you will catch your death
of cold.”</p>

<p>“My love, the carriage is waiting and you
must excuse me; it is growing late. It has
been delightful to be with you, and to meet
your friends.”</p>

<p>She shook hands with Mr. Fisher, and
bowed to Ethel Dunlop; then she went
slowly out of the room on Walter’s arm, the
long train of Madame Celestine’s dress
sweeping behind her.</p>

<p>“Good-night, Mrs. Hibbert,” Mr. Wimple
said, and, shaking hands quickly with the
air of a man who has many engagements
and suddenly remembered one that must be
instantly kept, he too was gone.</p>

<p>He was just in time to reach the carriage
door.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Baines,” he said, “I think you said
you were going to South Kensington—could
you take me as far as Queen’s Gate?”</p>

<p>“I wonder where he is going,” Walter
said to himself as he went upstairs again;
“I don’t believe he knows a soul in Queen’s
Gate.”</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER V.</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><img class='dropcap' src='images/capw.jpg' style='float:left;width:5%;' alt='W'/>alter</span> was going to India for the
winter. It had all been arranged
while Aunt Anne sat out on the balcony
with Mr. Wimple. Mr. Fisher had explained
to Florence that the paper wanted a new
correspondent for a time, and that it would
be an excellent thing for Walter to get the
change and movement of the new life. He
was to go out by P. and O., making a short
stay at Gibraltar, for business purposes, as
well as one at Malta. He had looked
anxiously enough at his wife when they
were alone again that evening; but she had
put out her hands as if in congratulation.</p>

<p>“I am very glad,” was all she said, “it
will do you good and make you strong.”</p>

<p>“To live for you and the chicks, my
sweet.”</p>

<p>And so they arranged the getting ready;
for he was to start by the very next boat,
and that sailed in ten days’ time.</p>

<p>“If your mother had been in England
you might have gone with me as far as Gib,”
Walter remarked. “I suppose you would
be afraid to leave the servants in charge?”</p>

<p>“I should like to go,” she answered, as
she poured out the coffee—it was breakfast
time—“but I couldn’t leave the children.”</p>

<p>“By Jove,” Walter exclaimed, not heeding
her answer, “there’s Aunt Anne in a hansom!
I say, Floggie dear, let me escape. What
on earth does she mean by coming at this
hour of the morning? Say I’m not down
yet, and shall be at least three hours before
I am; but keep the breakfast hot somehow.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t you see her?”</p>

<p>“No, no, she would want to weep over me
if she heard that I was going, and I know
I should laugh. Manage to get rid of her
soon.” And he flew upstairs as the street
door was opened.</p>

<p>“My dear Florence,” Mrs. Baines said,
as she walked in with a long footstep and a
truly tragic air, “let me put my arms round
you, my poor darling.”</p>

<p>“Why, Aunt Anne, what is the matter?”
Florence asked cheerfully, and with considerable
astonishment.</p>

<p>“You are very brave, my love,” the old
lady said, scanning her niece’s face, “but I
know all; an hour ago I had a letter telling
me of Walter’s departure. My dear, it will
break your heart.”</p>

<p>“But why?”</p>

<p>“My love, it will.”</p>

<p>“Oh no,” Florence said, “I am not so
foolish. Life is full of ordinary events that
bring out very keen feelings, I have been
thinking that lately, but one must learn to
take them calmly.”</p>

<p>“You do not know what you will suffer
when he is gone.”</p>

<p>“No, Aunt Anne, I shall miss him, of
course; but I shall hope that he is enjoying
himself.”</p>

<p>“My dear Florence, I expected to find
you broken-hearted.”</p>

<p>“That would be cruel to him. I am glad
he is going, it will do him good, and really
I have not had time to think of myself yet,
I have been so busy.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Baines considered for a moment.</p>

<p>“That is the reason, I knew there was
an explanation somewhere,” she said in an
earnest emotional tone. “I knew how unselfish
you were from the first moment I saw
you, Florence. It is like you, my darling,
not to think of yourself. Try not to do so,
for you will feel your loneliness bitterly
enough when he is gone.”</p>

<p>“But don’t tell me so,” Florence said, half
crying, half laughing. “How did you know
about it, Aunt Anne?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Wimple told me.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Wimple—have you seen him then?”</p>

<p>“My love, he is one of the most cultivated
men I ever met; we have many
tastes and sympathies in common. He
wrote to ask me to meet him by the Albert
Memorial.”</p>

<p>“To meet him!” Florence exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered the old lady solemnly.
“He agrees with me that never was there
in any age or country a more beautiful work
than the Albert Memorial. We arranged to
meet and examine it together; he wrote to
me just now and mentioned that Walter was
going to India; I telegraphed instantly that
I could see no one else to-day, for I thought
you would welcome my loving sympathy. I
came to offer it to you, Florence.” She said
the last words in a disappointed and injured
voice.</p>

<p>“It was very kind of you, Aunt Anne;
but indeed I have only had time to be glad
that he would get a rest and pleasant change
of work.”</p>

<p>“I must see him before he goes; I may
never do so again,” Mrs. Baines said, after
a pause.</p>

<p>“Oh yes, you will, dear.”</p>

<p>“I have brought him two little tokens
that I thought of him as I hastened to you
after hearing the news. I know they will
be useful to him. These are glycerine
lozenges, Florence; they are excellent for
the throat. The sea mist or the desert sand
is sure to affect it.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, it was very kind of you;
you are much too generous—you make us
quite uneasy.” Florence was miserable at
the two evils suggested.</p>

<p>“My love, if I had thousands a year you
should have them,” Aunt Anne answered,
and, intent on her present-making, she went
on, “and here is a little case of scissors,
they are of different sizes. I know how
much gentlemen”—Aunt Anne always said
“gentlemen,” never “men,” as do the women
of to-day—“like to find a pair suited to their
requirements at the moment; I thought they
might be useful to him on the voyage.” She
gave a sigh of relief as though presenting
her gifts had removed a load from her mind.
“I suppose Walter is not down yet, my
love?”</p>

<p>“He is upstairs,” Florence said, a little
guiltily, “I am afraid he will not be down
just yet.”</p>

<p>Aunt Anne gave a reflective wink, as
though she perfectly understood the reason
of Walter’s non-appearance; but if she did
she had far too much tact to betray it.</p>

<p>“If it be your wish, my dear, I will forego
the pleasure of saying a last good-bye to him.”</p>

<p>“Well, dear Aunt Anne, when he does
come down he will have a great deal to
do,” Florence answered still more guiltily,
for she could not help feeling that Aunt
Anne saw through the ruse.</p>

<p>“My love, I quite understand,” Mrs.
Baines said solemnly, “and he will know
that it was from no lack of affection that
I did not wait to see him. Tell him that
he will be constantly in my thoughts;” and
she slowly gathered her cashmere shawl
round her shoulders, and buttoned her black
kid gloves.</p>

<p>“Poor Aunt Anne,” Florence thought when
she had gone, she would wring a tragedy
from every daily trial if she were encouraged.
“Oh, you wicked coward,” she said to Walter,
“to run away like that.”</p>

<p>“Yes, my darling; but I am starved, and
really, you know, Floggie, confound Aunt
Anne.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but she is very kind,” Florence said,
as she displayed the presents. “How did
Mr. Wimple know that you were going to
India?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I met him yesterday at the office. He
went to see Fisher; it was arranged that he
should the other night.”</p>

<p>“It is very extraordinary his striking up
a friendship with Aunt Anne.”</p>

<p>“Yes, very extraordinary,” he laughed
and then the old lady was forgotten.</p>

<p>The days flew by and the last one came.
To-morrow (Thursday) Walter was to start
by an early train for Southampton. All his
arrangements were complete, and on that
last day he had virtually nothing to do,
“therefore, Floggie dear,” he pleaded, “let
us have a spree.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she answered, willingly enough,
though her heart was heavier than his.
“How shall we manage it?”</p>

<p>“Let us stroll about all day or go to
Richmond, and come back and have a cosy
little dinner somewhere.”</p>

<p>“Here,” she pleaded, “let us dine here,
in our own home on this last evening; we’ll
have a very nice dinner.”</p>

<p>“Very nice indeed?”</p>

<p>“Very nice indeed, you greedy thing.”</p>

<p>“All right, darling, suppose you go and
order it. Then get ready and let’s start as
soon as possible; we’ll amuse ourselves well,
and forget that we have not a month to do
it in. Live and be happy in the present
day, dear Floggie,” he went on in a mock-serious
tone; “for there is always a chance
that to-morrow will not declare itself.”</p>

<p>So they went off, like the boy he was in
spite of his more than thirty years, and the
girl that she sometimes felt herself to be
still in spite of the two children and the
eight years of matrimony. They walked a
little way. Then Walter had a brilliant
idea.</p>

<p>“Let’s get into a hansom,” he said, “drive
to Waterloo and take the first train that is
going in any pleasant direction; I think
Waterloo is the best place for that sort of
speculation. This beggar’s horse looks pretty
good, jump in.”</p>

<p>As they drove up to the station, a four-wheel
cab moved away, the cabman grumbling
at the sum that had been given him
by two people, a man and a woman, who
still stood on the station steps looking after
him.</p>

<p>“Why, there’s Wimple!” Walter exclaimed;
“and who’s that with him, I
wonder?”</p>

<p>Florence looked up quickly. Mr. Wimple
wore a shabby grey coat, and round his
neck and over his mouth there was a grey
comforter, for the October morning was
slightly chilly. In his hand he carried a
worn brown portmanteau. Beside him stood
a tall good-looking young woman of five-and-twenty,
commonly, almost vulgarly dressed.
She looked after the departing cab with a
scowl on her face that told it was she who
had paid the scanty fare. As they stood
together, they looked poor and common and
singularly unprepossessing; it was impossible
to help feeling that they were nearly connected.
They looked like husband and wife,
and of an indefinite and insignificant class.
Suddenly Alfred Wimple caught Walter’s
eye, he nodded gravely without the least
confusion, but he evidently said something
quickly and in a low tone to his companion,
for they hurried away through one of the
station doors.</p>

<p>“That horrid Mr. Wimple seems to possess
us lately,” Florence thought.</p>

<p>As they went from the ticket office she
saw Mr. Wimple and his friend hurrying
along the platform. A minute later they
had entered a Portsmouth train which was
on the point of starting.</p>

<p>“If that’s his Liphook friend I don’t think
much of the looks of her. Alfred always
picked up odd people,” Walter thought;
but he kept these reflections to himself; all
he said aloud was, “I say, Floggie dear, if
Wimple turns up while I’m away, don’t be
uncivil to him, and give him food if you can
manage it. Somehow he always looks half
starved, poor beggar. Fisher is going to
give him some reviewing to do, perhaps that
will help him a bit.”</p>

<p>There was a train starting to Windsor in
ten minutes; so they went by it, and strolled
down by the river and lingered near the
boats, and went into the town and looked
at the shops and the outside of the castle.
Then they lunched at the confectioner’s, an
extravagant lunch which Walter ordered, and
afterwards, while they were still drowsy and
happy, they hired an open fly and drove to
Virginia Water. They hurried back to
Windsor in time to catch the 6 p.m. train for
town by half a minute, and congratulated
themselves upon finding an empty carriage.</p>

<p>“I shall always remember this dear day,”
Florence said, as they sat over their last
little dinner at home.</p>

<p>“That’s a good thing,” Walter said, “and
so will I, dear wife. When I come back
we’ll have another like it in memory of this
one’s success.” Then he remembered Alfred
Wimple. “I should like to know who that
girl was,” he thought; “wonder if she’s the
daughter of another tailor he doesn’t want to
pay, and if I met him to-morrow I wonder
what lie he would tell me about her—he
always lied, poor beggar.” And this shows
that his thoughts were sometimes not as
charitable as his words.</p>

<p>The next day very early Walter departed
for Southampton. Florence went to see him
safely on board.</p>

<p>“We shall have the good little journey
together,” he said dismally, for he was loth
enough to leave her now that the parting
time had come.</p>

<p>But it seemed as if the train flew along the
rails in its hurry to get near the sea, and the
journey was over directly. There was all
the bustle of getting on board; and almost
before she knew it, Florence was on her way
back to London alone. As if in a dream
she walked home from the station, thinking
of her husband watching the sea as it widened
between him and England. She was glad
she had seen the ship, she could imagine him
seated at the long table in the saloon, with
the punkahs—useless enough at present—waving
overhead, or in his cabin, looking out
through the porthole at the white crests to
the waves. Yes. She could see all his surroundings
plainly. She gave a long sigh.
She was a brave little woman, and had tried
so hard not to break down before Walter,
though in the last moment on board, when
she had felt as if her heart would break,
she had not been able altogether to help
it. And now, as she walked home in the
dusk without him, she felt as if she could
not live through the long months of separation.</p>

<p>“But I will—I will,” she said to herself
while the tears trickled down her face;
“only it <span class='it'>is</span> hard, for there is no one in the
world like him, no one—no one; and we
have never been parted before.”</p>

<p>Every moment, too, she remembered, took
him farther away. She told herself again
and again how much good the journey would
do him, how glad she was that he would get
the change; but human nature is human
nature still, and will not be controlled by
argument. So she quickened her pace,
resolving not to give way till she was safe
in the darkness of her own room, hidden
from the eyes of the servants, and then she
would let her feelings have their fling.</p>

<p>She looked up at the house with a sigh.
It would be so still without Walter. There
was a flickering light in the drawing-room.
Probably the servants had put a lamp there,
for the days were growing shorter; it was
nearly dark already. The children would
be in bed, but they were certain not to be
asleep, and she thought of the little shout
of welcome they would give when they heard
her footstep on the stair as she went up to
kiss them. She let herself in with Walter’s
latchkey—she kissed it as she took it from
her pocket, and nearly cried again—and then,
having entered, stood still and wondered.
There in the hall were two square boxes—boxes
of the sort that were used before overland
trunks came into fashion, and when
American arks were unknown. They were
covered with brown holland, bordered with
faded red braid, and corded with thick brown
cord. Stitched on to each cover was a small
white card, on each of which was written, in
a hand Florence knew well, <span class='it'>Mrs. Baines,
care of Mrs. Walter Hibbert</span>. While she
was still contemplating the address, a servant,
who had heard her enter, came up.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Baines has been here since eleven
o’clock, ma’am,” she said; “she’s in the drawing-room,
and has had nothing to eat all day
except a cup of tea, and a little toast that
nurse made her have at four o’clock. She’s
been waiting to see you.”</p>

<p>It was evident that there had been some
catastrophe. Florence went wearily upstairs,
and, after a moment’s hesitation to gather
courage, entered the drawing-room.</p>

<p>“Aunt Anne!” she exclaimed, “what has
happened?”</p>

<p>The old lady had been standing by the
fireplace. Her thin white hands were bare,
but she still wore her cloak and black close-fitting
bonnet, though she had thrown aside
the crape veil. Her face looked worn and
anxious, but a look of indignation came to
her eyes when she saw Florence, a last
little flash of remembered insult: then she
advanced with outstretched hands.</p>

<p>“Florence,” she said, “I have come to
you for advice and shelter, I have been
insulted—and humiliated”—a quaver came
into her voice, she could not go on till
indignation returned to give her strength.
“Florence,” she begun again, “I have come
to you. I—I——”</p>

<p>“Aunt Anne, dear Aunt Anne!” Florence
said, aching with fatigue, and feeling ruefully
that her longing for rest and quiet was not
likely to be satisfied, yet thinking, oddly
enough too, even while she spoke, of Walter
going on, farther and farther away across the
darkening sea, “what is the matter? tell me,
dear.” There was a throbbing pain in her
head. It was like the thud-thud of the screw
on board his ship.</p>

<p>Aunt Anne raised her head and spoke
firmly—</p>

<p>“My love, I have been insulted.”</p>

<p>“Insulted, Aunt Anne, but how?”</p>

<p>“Yes, my love, insulted. I frequently
had occasion to reprove the servants for
their conduct, for the want of respect they
showed me. The cook was abominable, and
a reprimand had no effect upon her. To-day
her impertinence was past endurance, I told
Mrs. North so, and that she must be dismissed.
Mrs. North refused—refused,
though her servant had forgotten what was
due to me, and this morning—— I can’t
repeat her words.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Florence, “but surely you
did not let a servant drive——”</p>

<p>“No, dear Florence, it was not the cook
who drove me away, I should not allow a
subordinate to interfere with my life; it was
Mrs. North. She has behaved cruelly to
me. She listened to her servants in preference
to me. I told her that they showed
me no respect, that they entirely forgot what
was due to me, and unless she made an
example, and dismissed one of them, it would
be impossible for me to stay in her house,
and then, my love, I was told that—that,” she
stopped for a moment, “I can’t tell you,”
she went on suddenly; “I can’t repeat it all,
Florence; but, my love, there were other
reasons—that are impossible to repeat; and
I am here—I am here, homeless and
miserable, and insulted. I flew to you, I
knew you would be indignant, that your
dear heart would feel for me.”</p>

<p>“But you were so happy.”</p>

<p>“Yes, my love, I was.”</p>

<p>“And Mrs. North was so kind to you,”
Florence went on regretfully; “could you
not have managed——”</p>

<p>“No, my love, I must remember what is
due to myself.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but, dear Aunt Anne, don’t you
think it would have been better to have put
up——”</p>

<p>“Florence, if you cannot sympathize with
me I must ask you not to discuss the matter,”
the old lady answered, raising her head and
speaking in a tone of surprise; “there is no
trouble you could have come to me with that
I should not have felt about as you did.”</p>

<p>Aunt Anne had a remarkable gift for
fighting her own battles, Florence thought.</p>

<p>“But don’t you see, Aunt Anne, that——”</p>

<p>“I would prefer not to discuss the matter,
my love,” the old lady said loftily. “You
are so young and inexperienced that perhaps
you cannot enter into my feelings. Either
the cook or I had to leave the house. There
were other reasons too, I repeat, why I
deemed it unadvisable,—why it was impossible
to remain. Mrs. North has lately shown a
levity of manner that I could not countenance;
her sister is no longer with her, and
her husband has been thousands of miles
away; is away still, yet she is always ready
for amusement. I cannot believe that she
loves him, or she would show more regret at
his absence. I have known what a happy
marriage is, Florence, and you know what
it is too, my love. You can therefore understand
that I thought her conduct reprehensible.
I felt it my duty to tell her so.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Florence said wearily, “I know,
I know;” but she could not help thinking
that Aunt Anne had behaved rather foolishly.</p>

<p>Then she rang the bell and ordered tea to
be made ready in the dining-room, a substantial
tea of the sort that women love and
men abhor.</p>

<p>“Now rest and forget all the worries,”
she said gently. “You are tired and excited,
try and forget everything till you have
had some tea and are rested. The spare
room is quite ready, and you shall go to bed
early, as I will, for it has been a long day.”</p>

<p>“I know what you must have gone
through,” and Mrs. Baines shook her head
sadly, “and that you want to be alone to
think of your dear Walter. But I will only
intrude on you for one night, to-morrow I
will find an apartment.”</p>

<p>“You must not talk like that, for you are
very welcome, Aunt Anne,” Florence said
gently, though she could not help inwardly
chafing at the intrusion, and longing to be
alone.</p>

<p>“Tell me, love, did Walter go off comfortably?”
Mrs. Baines asked, speaking with
the air people sometimes speak of those who
have died rather to the satisfaction of their
relations.</p>

<p>“Yes, he sailed a few hours ago. I have
just come back from Southampton.”</p>

<p>“I know it,” Aunt Anne answered, her
voice full of untold feeling; “did he take my
simple gifts with him, dear?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he took them,” Florence answered
gratefully; “but come downstairs, Aunt
Anne, you must be worn out.”</p>

<p>Then in a moment Aunt Anne recovered
her old manner, the manner that had some
indefinable charm in it, and looked at
Florence.</p>

<p>“Yes, my love,” she said, “I am very
much fatigued but I am thankful indeed to
enjoy your hospitality again. Before I retire
to rest I must write some letters, if you will
permit your servant to post them.”</p>

<p>Florence had to write one or two letters
also. She gave three to the little housemaid
to post; as she did so, one of Aunt Anne’s
caught her eye. It was addressed to Alfred
Wimple. “Perhaps she wanted to tell him
something about the Albert Memorial,” she
thought, and dismissed the matter from her
mind.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER VI.</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><img class='dropcap' src='images/capt.jpg' style='float:left;width:5%;' alt='T'/>hen</span> it was that Florence discovered
that Aunt Anne was really a charming
person to have in the house, especially
with children. She was so bright, so clever
with them, so full of little surprises. In her
pocket there always lingered some unexpected
little present, and at the tip of her
tongue some quaint bit of old-world knowledge
that was as interesting to grown-up
folk as to the children. To see her prim
figure about the place seemed to Florence
like having lavender among her linen. She
was useful too, ready with her fingers to darn
some little place in a tablecloth that every
one else had overlooked, to sew a button on
Monty’s little shoe, or to mend a tear in
Catty’s pinafore. Above all, she was so
complimentary, so full of admiration, and it
was quite evident that she meant with her
whole heart all the pretty things she said.
She did too. Walter was the son of her
favourite brother, and to Florence she had
really taken a fancy from the beginning.</p>

<p>“I loved you from the first moment, my
love,” she said. “I shall never forget the
look of happiness on your face that morning
at Brighton when I met you and your dear
Walter together. It endeared you to me.
It was a happy day,” she added, with a sigh.</p>

<p>“Yes, a very happy day,” Florence answered,
affectionately remembering how ungrateful
both she and dear Walter had been
at the time. This was at breakfast one
morning, a week after Walter’s departure.
She was pouring out the coffee very quickly
because she longed to open her letters,
though she knew it was not possible to get
yet the one he had posted from Gibraltar.</p>

<p>Aunt Anne meanwhile was undoing a little
packet that had come by post addressed to
her. Catty and Monty having finished
their porridge were intently watching. She
stopped when she noticed the gravity of
their faces.</p>

<p>“My love,” she said, in the tone of one
asking a great favour, “have I your permission
to give these dear children some bread
and jam?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, of course,” Florence answered,
not looking up from the long letter she was
reading.</p>

<p>Aunt Anne, quick to notice, saw that it
had a foreign postmark and an enclosure
that looked like a cheque. Then she cut
some bread and took off the crust before she
spread a quantity of butter on the dainty
slices, and piled on the top of the butter as
much jam as they could carry.</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried the children, with gleeful
surprise.</p>

<p>“Dear Aunt Anne,” exclaimed Florence,
looking up when she heard it, “I never give
them quite so much butter with quite so
much jam. It is too rich for them, and we
don’t cut off the crusts.”</p>

<p>“The servants will eat them.”</p>

<p>“Indeed they will not,” laughed Florence;
“they don’t like crusts.”</p>

<p>“You are much too good to them, love,
as you are to every one. They should do
as they are told, and be glad to take what
they can get. I never have patience with
the lower classes,” she added, in the gentlest
of voices.</p>

<p>But the words gave Florence a sudden
insight into the possible reason of Aunt
Anne’s collapse at Mrs. North’s, a catastrophe
to which the old lady never referred. The
very mention of Mrs. North’s name made her
manner a little distant.</p>

<p>“And then, you know,” Florence said, for
she was always careful, and now especially,
in order to make the very short allowance on
which she had put herself in her husband’s
absence hold out, “we must not let the
children learn to be dainty, must we? So
they must try to eat up the crusts of their
bread; and we only give them a little butter
when they have jam. I never had butter and
jam together at all at home,” and she stroked
Catty’s fat little hand while she went on
reading her letter. “Grandma has written
from France, my babes,” she said, looking
up after a few minutes; “she sends you
each a kiss and five shillings to spend.”</p>

<p>“I shall buy a horse and be a soldier,”
Monty declared.</p>

<p>“I shall buy a present for mummy and a
little one for Aunt Anne,” said Catty.</p>

<p>“Bless you, my darling, for thinking of
me,” the old lady said fervently, and suddenly
opening a tin of Devonshire cream,
she piled a mass of it on to the bread and
butter and jam already before the astonished
children. Aunt Anne’s nature gloried in
profusion.</p>

<p>“Why,” said Florence, not noticing anything
at table, “here is a letter from Madame
Celestine—her name is on the seal at least.
I don’t owe her anything. Oh no, it isn’t
for me. <span class='it'>Mrs. Baines, care of Mrs. Walter
Hibbert.</span> It is for you, Aunt Anne.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, my love.” Mrs. Baines took
it, with an air of slight but dignified vexation.
“It was remiss of your servant not
to put all my letters beside me. I am sorry
you should be troubled with my correspondence.”</p>

<p>“But it doesn’t matter,” Florence answered.
“I hope you have not found her very expensive;
she can be so sometimes?” and
through Florence’s mind there went a remembrance
of the dress in which Aunt
Anne had appeared on the night of the
dinner-party. A little flush, or something
like one, went across the old lady’s withered
cheek.</p>

<p>“My love,” she said, almost haughtily, “I
have not yet given her charges my consideration.
I have been too much engaged with
more important matters.”</p>

<p>“I sincerely hope she does not owe for that
dress,” Florence thought, but she did not
dare ask any questions. “Madame Celestine
is not a comfortable creditor, nor usually
a small one.”</p>

<p>Then she understood Catty’s and Monty’s
remarkable silence of the past few minutes.
It had suddenly dawned upon her how unusual
it was.</p>

<p>“Why, my beloved babes,” she exclaimed,
“what are you eating?” and she looked
across laughingly at Aunt Anne. “Where
did those snowy mountains of cream come
from?”</p>

<p>“They came by post, just now, my love,”
Mrs. Baines said firmly.</p>

<p>“Oh, you are much too kind, Aunt Anne.
But you will spoil the children, you will
indeed, as well as their digestions. You
are much too good to them; but we shall
have to send them away if you corrupt
them in this delicious manner.”</p>

<p>“It is most nutritious, I assure you,” Aunt
Anne answered, with great gravity, while
with dogged and desperate haste she piled
more and more cream on to Monty’s plate.
“I thought you would like it, Florence.
I have ordered three pounds to be sent in
one-pound tins at intervals of three days.
I hoped that you would think it good for
the dear children, that they would have your
approbation in eating it.”</p>

<p>“Of course, and I shall eat some too,”
Florence answered, trying to chase away
Aunt Anne’s earnestness; “only you are
much too good to them.”</p>

<p>The old lady looked up with a tender
smile on her face.</p>

<p>“It is not possible to be good enough
to your children, my darling—yours and
Walter’s.”</p>

<p>“Dear Walter,” said Florence, as she
rose from the table, “I shall be glad to get
his letter. Now, my monkeys, my vagabonds,
my darlings, go upstairs and tell
nurse to take you out at once to see the
trees and the ducks in the pond; go along,
go along,” and she ran playfully after the
children.</p>

<p>“May I go and buy my horse?” asked
Monty; “and I think I shall buy a sword
too. I want to kill a man.”</p>

<p>“He is just like his father!” exclaimed
Aunt Anne. “What is Catty going to do
with her money?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Give it to mummy,” the child answered
softly.</p>

<p>“And she is just like you, dear Florence,”
said the old lady, in a choking voice.</p>

<p>“She is just like herself, and therefore
like a dickie-bird, and a white rabbit, and
a tortoiseshell kitten, and many other things
too numerous to mention,” Florence laughed,
overtaking Catty and kissing her little round
face. “But go, my babes, go—go and get
ready; your beloved mummy wants to turn
you out of doors;” and shouting with joy
the children scampered off.</p>

<p>Florence took up <span class='it'>The Centre</span>.</p>

<p>“Won’t you have the paper, Aunt Anne,
and a quiet quarter of an hour?”</p>

<p>“Thank you, no, my love; I rarely care
to peruse it until a more leisure time of the
day. With your permission I will leave you
now, I have some business to transact out of
doors; are there any commissions I could
execute for you?”</p>

<p>“No, thank you.”</p>

<p>Aunt Anne was always thoughtful, Florence
said to herself. Every morning since she
came this question had been asked and
answered in almost the same words.</p>

<p>“By the way, Aunt Anne, Mr. Wimple
called yesterday. I am sorry I was not at
home”—and this she felt to be a fib.</p>

<p>“He told me that he intended to do so
before he left town.”</p>

<p>There was a strange light on Aunt Anne’s
face when she spoke of him; her niece saw
it with wonder.</p>

<p>“I dare say she takes a sort of motherly
interest in him,” she said to herself. “He
is delicate and she has no belongings; poor
old lady, how sad it must be to have no
belongings, no husband, no children, no
mother, no anything. I don’t wonder her
sympathies go out even to Mr. Wimple.”
Then aloud she asked, “Is he going away
for long?”</p>

<p>“He is going to some friends near Portsmouth
by the twelve o’clock train to-day,”
and Mrs. Baines glanced at the clock; “from
Waterloo,” she added.</p>

<p>“Are you going to see him off, Aunt
Anne?”</p>

<p>“My love, I have an engagement in the
City at one o’clock. I am going out now,
but I cannot say what my movements will
be between this and then.”</p>

<p>In a moment Aunt Anne’s voice was a
shade distant. Florence had only asked the
question as a little joke, and with no notion
that Aunt Anne would take it seriously.</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean to be curious,” she said,
and stroked the old lady’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“I know you did not, my darling. You
are the last person in the world to commit
a solecism,”—and again there came a smile
to Aunt Anne’s face. It made Florence
stoop and kiss her.</p>

<p>“And you told me of your expedition
to the Albert Memorial, remember,” she went
on wickedly; “and I know that you and Mr.
Wimple are very sympathetic to each other.”</p>

<p>“You are right, Florence. We have many
tastes and sympathies in unison. We find it
pleasant to discuss them altogether. Good-bye,
my love; do not wait luncheon for me.
I shall probably partake of it with a friend”—and
she left the room. Florence took up
<span class='it'>The Centre</span> again, but she could not read for
thinking uneasily of the bill which she felt
convinced Madame Celestine had just sent
to Aunt Anne.</p>

<p>“I wish I could pay it,” she thought;
“but I can’t, in spite of mother’s present
this morning. It is probably at least fifteen
pounds. Besides, Aunt Anne is such a
peculiar old lady that the chances are she
would be offended if I did.”</p>

<p>She put down the paper and sat thinking
for a few minutes. Then she went to the
writing-table in the corner by the fireplace,
unlocked the corner drawer and took out a
little china bowl in which she was in the
habit of keeping the money she had in the
house. Four pounds in gold and a five-pound
note. She took out the note, put in
a cheque, locked the drawer and waited.</p>

<p>When she heard the soft footsteps of Aunt
Anne descending the stairs she went to the
door nervously, uncertain how what she was
going to do would be received. Mrs. Baines
was dressed ready to go out. She was a
little smarter than usual. Round her throat
there was some soft white muslin tied in a
large bow that fell on her chest and relieved
the sombreness of her attire. The heavy
crape veil she usually wore was replaced by
a thinner one that had little spots of jet
upon it.</p>

<p>“Aunt Anne, you look as if you were
going to a party.”</p>

<p>The old lady was almost confused, like a
person who is found out in some roguish
mischief of which she is half, but only half,
ashamed.</p>

<p>“My love, I only go to your parties,” she
said; “there are no others in the world that
would tempt me.”</p>

<p>“Can you come to me for five minutes
before you start? I won’t keep you
longer.”</p>

<p>“Yes, with pleasure,” Aunt Anne answered;
“but it must only be for five minutes, if you
will excuse me for saying so, for I have an
appointment that I should deeply regret not
being able to keep.”</p>

<p>Florence led the old lady to an easy-chair
and shut the door. Then she knelt down
by her side, saying humbly but with a voice
full of joy, for she was delighted at what she
was going to do—if Aunt Anne would only
let her do it.</p>

<p>“I want to tell you that—that I had a
letter from my mother this morning.”</p>

<p>“I know, my love. I hope she is well,
and that you have no anxiety about her.”</p>

<p>“Oh no.”</p>

<p>“She must long to see you, Florence dear.”</p>

<p>“She does; she is such a dear mother, and
she is coming to England in two or three
weeks’ time.”</p>

<p>“Her society will be a great solace to you.”</p>

<p>“Yes; but what I wanted to tell you is
that she has sent me a present.”</p>

<p>“I hope it is a substantial one,” Aunt
Anne said, courteously.</p>

<p>“Indeed it is.”</p>

<p>“It rejoices me greatly to hear it, my love.”</p>

<p>“It is money—a cheque. My mother
says she sends it to cheer me up after losing
Walter.”</p>

<p>“She knew how your tender heart would
miss him, my darling;” but she was watching
Florence intently with a hungry look
that a second self seemed trying to control.</p>

<p>“And as I have had a present of filthy
lucre, Aunt Anne, and am delighted and not
too proud to take it, so I want you to have
a present of filthy lucre and not to be too
proud to take it; but just to have this little
five-pound note because you love me and
for any little odd and end on which you may
find it convenient to spend it. It would be
so sweet of you to let me share my present
as my children shared the cream with you.”</p>

<p>Florence bent her head and kissed the old
lady’s hands as she pushed the bit of crisp
paper into them. Aunt Anne was not one
whit offended, it seemed for a moment as if
she were going to break down and cry; but
she controlled herself.</p>

<p>“Bless you, my darling, bless you indeed.
I take it in the spirit you offer
it me; I know the pleasure it is to your
generous heart to give, and it is equally
one to mine to receive. I could not refuse
any gift from you, Florence,” she said, kissing
Mrs. Hibbert; and when she departed,
it was with an air of having done a gracious
and tender deed. But besides this, her
footstep had grown lighter, there was a joyfulness
in her voice and a flickering smile
on her face that showed how much pleasure
and relief the money had given her.</p>

<p>“I am so glad,” Florence thought, as she
noticed it; “poor old dear. I wonder if it
will go to Madame Celestine, or what she
will do with it. And I wonder where she
is gone.”</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER VII.</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><img class='dropcap' src='images/capf.jpg' style='float:left;width:5%;' alt='F'/>lorence’s</span> speculations concerning
Aunt Anne were brought to an end
by the arrival of Mr. Fisher. She was surprised
at his paying her so early a visit, and
for a moment feared lest it should mean bad
news from Walter. But his benevolent expression
reassured her.</p>

<p>“I hope you will forgive my intruding on
you at this hour, Mrs. Hibbert,” he said.
“My visit is almost a business one, if I may
venture to call it so, and I hope its result
may be pleasant to us both.” His manner
was a faint echo of Aunt Anne’s. “I would
have written to ask you to see me, but the
idea that brings me only occurred to me an
hour or two ago.”</p>

<p>“But of course I would see you,” she
answered brightly. “And I think the morning
is a delicious time of day to which we
devote far too much idleness.”</p>

<p>“I thoroughly agree with you,” he said,
and looked at her approvingly, for he was
quite alive to the duties of domesticity. In
his short married life it had been an everlasting
irritation to him that his wife was
a slattern and wholly indifferent about her
home. It had made him keen to observe
the ways of other women; though the sight
of a well-kept house always depressed him
a little, for it set him thinking of the denials
in his own life, of what he might have had
and could have been; it made him also a
little extra deferential and gracious to the
woman who presided over it. He was so
to Florence this morning. He had noticed
quickly that all signs of breakfast had vanished,
he divined that the children were out
of doors, and that she herself, with her slate
and account-books, was deep in household
matters. It was thus he thought that a
woman should chiefly concern herself. Her
husband, children, and home were her business
in life. The rest could be left to the
discretion and management of men. He
felt that it was almost a duty on his part, in
the absence of her husband, to discreetly
manage Florence. Moreover, in the intervals
of editing his paper, he had a turn for
editing the lives of other people, and he
felt it almost an obligation to give a good
deal of time to the consideration of the
private affairs of his staff. He liked the
Hibberts too, and was really anxious to be
good and useful to them. He had come to
the conclusion that it was a pity that
Florence and her children should stay in
London while Walter was away. “She
would be much better in the country,” he
thought; “the children could run about;
besides, what is the good of keeping that
cottage near Witley empty?” and then he remembered
his own mother, who was seventy
years old and lived far off in the wilds of
Northumberland. Her sole amusement
appeared to be writing her son letters,
lamenting that he never went to stay with
her, and that since he lived in small and inconvenient
bachelor chambers, she could not
go and stay with him. It had been her
desire that he should marry again. She
had told him that it was foolish not to do
so, that she could die happy if he had a
wife to take care of him. But he never
answered a word. “It would not be a bad
idea if I had the old lady up for a couple
of months, and took the Hibberts’ house,”
he said to himself. The idea grew upon
him. He imagined the dinners he could
give to his staff and their wives—not to the
outside world, for it bothered him. “We
might ask Ethel Dunlop occasionally,” he
thought; “a nice girl in her twenties, fond of
pleasure, would brighten up the old lady.”
He remembered the twenties with regret,
and wished they were thirties; then he
would not have felt so keenly the difference
in years between them. But he reflected
that after all he was still in the prime of
life, as a man is, if he chooses, till he is
fifty; and he struggled to feel youthful; but
struggle as he would, youthful feelings held
aloof. They were coy after forty, he supposed,
and looking back he consoled himself
by thinking that they had been rather foolish.
Then he thought of Ethel’s cousin;
confound her cousin! she seemed to like
going about with him. Perhaps he made
love to her; yet he was too much of a
hobble-de-hoy for that, surely—three-and-twenty
at most—a very objectionable time
of life in the masculine sex, a time of dash
and impudence and doing of things from
sheer bravado at which wisdom, knowledge,
and middle age hesitated. Ethel was probably
only amusing herself with him. To
fall in love with a cousin would show a lack
of originality of which he was slow to suspect
her. He wondered what the cousin
did, and if he wanted a post of any sort; if
he had a turn for writing and adventure.
Perhaps he could be sent as special correspondent
to the Gold Coast, where the climate
would probably sufficiently engross him.
Ethel at any rate might be invited to see his
mother, it would cheer the old lady up to
have a girl about her. Yes, he had quite
made up his mind. Mrs. Hibbert should go
to her country cottage with her two children;
he would take the house near Portland Road
for a couple of months, and the rest would
arrange itself.</p>

<p>“I don’t know whether Walter would like
it,” Florence said, when Mr. Fisher had explained
his errand.</p>

<p>“I’ll answer for Walter,” Mr. Fisher said
concisely. Of course he, a man, knew
better than she did what Walter, also a
man, would like; that was plainly conveyed
in his manner. “It will be better for you
and the children,” he went on, with gracious
benevolence, for as he looked at Florence
he thought how girlish she was. He felt
quite strongly that in her husband’s absence
it was his duty to look after her, and to
teach her, pleasantly, the way in which she
should go. It was absurd to suppose that
a woman should know it without any direction
from his sex, and he was now the proper
person to give it. “I will send you plenty
of novels to read, and if you would allow
me to introduce you to her,” he added, with
a shade of pomposity in his voice, “there is
a friend of mine at Witley—Mrs. Burnett.
You would be excellent companions for each
other, I should say, for her husband comes
up to town every morning, and——”</p>

<p>“I know her a little,” Florence said, “a
tall, slight woman with sweet grey eyes.”</p>

<p>“I never looked at her eyes,” Mr. Fisher
said quickly, and Florence felt reproved for
having mentioned them. Of course, he
would not look at the eyes of a married
woman. Mr. Fisher had clear and distinct
views about the proprieties, which he
thought were invented especially for married
and marriageable women. “Perhaps Miss
Dunlop would pay you a visit,” he suggested.</p>

<p>“She has her father to take care of.
Besides, Mrs. Baines is staying with me.”</p>

<p>“I saw Mrs. Baines with Wimple the
other day. Has she adopted him?”</p>

<p>“With Mr. Wimple,” Florence said, bewildered
at the sudden mention of the name
again; and then remembering Walter, she
added loyally, “she likes him because he is
Walter’s friend.”</p>

<p>“He writes well,” Mr. Fisher answered,
as if he were making a remark that surprised
himself. “He has done some work
for us, and done it very well too.”</p>

<p>Then he unfolded the details in regard to
the taking of the house.</p>

<p>Florence found to her surprise that he had
arranged them all carefully.</p>

<p>“Let me see,” he said, “this is Monday.
You can go on Saturday, I suppose? I
think that would be the best day for my
mother to arrive.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes. There are things to get ready
and to put away, of course.”</p>

<p>“They won’t take you long,” he answered
shortly.</p>

<p>“I dare say it will do the children good,”
she said, reluctantly.</p>

<p>“Of course it will.”</p>

<p>“I might ask Aunt Anne to take the
children to-morrow—I am sure she would—then
I could soon get the place ready.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Baines? Yes, it would be an excellent
plan to send her on first.”</p>

<p>“It is very kind of you; don’t you think
that you are really paying too much rent,
Mr. Fisher?”</p>

<p>“Not at all, not at all; it is a fair one,
and I shall be very glad to have the house.”</p>

<p>She was really a nice little woman, he
thought, docile, and far from stupid; she only
wanted a little managing. He had a suspicion
that Walter was too easy-going, and
if so, this little experience would be excellent
for her; it would teach her that after
all men were the governing race. It was
so foolish when women did not recognize it.</p>

<p>“Very well then, you will go on Saturday?
Good-bye. Oh, I should like to ask Miss
Dunlop to come and see my mother; do
you think she would mind cheering her up
sometimes?”</p>

<p>“Oh no. She is a nice girl too.”</p>

<p>“We might make a party to the theatre
one night perhaps. By the way, Mrs. Hibbert,”
he exclaimed, a sudden thought striking
him, “I shall write to Walter as soon
as I get to the office and tell him of this
arrangement. I might as well enclose a
note from you. The mail goes out to-day
from Southampton, so that it would be too
late to post, but I am sending specially by
rail. I will wait while you write a note,
and enclose it in mine.”</p>

<p>“I wrote by this mail last night,” she
answered. “But I should like to tell him
about the house—he might be angry.” She
laughed at the last words. She only said
them to keep up Walter’s dignity.</p>

<p>“Oh no, he won’t be angry,” Mr. Fisher
laughed back, and Florence thought he was
quite good-looking when he was not too
grave. He did not look more than forty
either; perhaps Ethel might be happy with
him. Then, when she had written a few
lines, he departed, satisfied with the result
of his visit.</p>

<p>An odd thing happened about that note.
He went straight to the office and found a
dozen matters of business awaiting his attention,
and all remembrance of the Hibberts
fled from him. Suddenly, an hour later, he
dived into his pocket for a memorandum,
and pulled out an unopened white envelope.
He did not look at the address. “What’s
this?” he said in utter forgetfulness, and
tore it open; and—for his own name caught
his eye—he read a passage in Mrs. Hibbert’s
note to her husband:—</p>

<p>“——<span class='it'>he is a kind old fogey, and I think
he likes Ethel D. Would it not be funny if
he married her?</span>”</p>

<p>He folded it up quickly for fear he should
read more. “Why should it be funny?” he
said to himself. The word haunted him all
day.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p>Meanwhile Aunt Anne was deeply engaged.
She was delighted with Florence’s unexpected
gift; it would enable her to do a few things
that only an hour or two ago she had felt
to be impossible. She had not the least
intention of paying Madame Celestine. She
looked upon her as an inferior who must
be content to wait till it was the pleasure of
her superior to remember her bill, and any
reminder of it she resented as a liberty.
She spent a happy and very excited hour
in Regent Street, and at eleven o’clock stood
on the kerbstone critically looking for a
hansom. She let several go by that did
not please her; but at last with excellent
instinct she picked out a good horse and a
smart driver, and a minute later was whirling
on towards Waterloo Station. She liked
driving in hansoms; she was of opinion
that they were well constructed, a great
improvement on older modes of conveyance,
and that it was the positive duty of people
in a certain rank of life to encourage all
meritorious achievements with their approval.
She never for a moment doubted that she
was one of those whose approval was important.
She felt her own individuality very
strongly, and was convinced that the world
recognized it. She was keenly sensible of
making effects, and it was odd, but for all
her eccentricities, there was in her the
making of a great lady; or it might have
seemed to a philosophical speculator that
she was made of the worn-out fragments of
some past great lady, and dimly remembered
at intervals her former importance. She
had perfect control over her manner, and
could use it to the best advantage; she had
reserve, a power of keeping off familiarity,
a graciousness, a winsomeness when she
chose, that all belonged to a certain type
and a certain class. As she went on swiftly
to the station she looked half-disdainfully,
yet compassionately, at the people who
walked and the people who passed in
omnibuses. She told herself that the last
were excellent institutions, she wondered
what the lower class would do without
them; it rejoiced her to think that they
had not got to do without them, it was a
satisfaction to feel that she could enjoy her
own superior condition without compunction.</p>

<p>At Waterloo, with an air of decision that
showed a perfect knowledge of her own
generosity, she gave the cabman sixpence
over his fare and walked slowly into the
station. She looked up and down the
platform from which the Portsmouth train
would depart, but saw no one she knew.
She stood for a moment hesitating, and
winked slowly to herself. Then she went
to the bookstall and bought a <span class='it'>Times</span> and a
<span class='it'>Morning Post</span>. The one cost threepence
and the other was fashionable. She disliked
penny papers. Again her mania for present-giving
asserted itself, and quickly she bought
also a pile of illustrated papers and magazines.
“Gentlemen always like the <span class='it'>Field</span>,” she said
to herself, and added it to the heap. She
turned away with them in her arms, and as
she did so Alfred Wimple stood facing her.</p>

<p>“I have ventured to get you a few
papers, hoping they would beguile you on
your journey,” she said.</p>

<p>Mr. Wimple was as grave as ever and as
rickety on his legs. His face showed no
sign of pleasure at the sight of the old lady,
but his manner was deferential; he seemed
to be trying to impress certain indefinite
facts upon her.</p>

<p>“I never read in a train,” he answered,
“but I shall be glad of them at the end of
the journey. Thank you.”</p>

<p>He said the last two words with a sigh,
and put them in the corner he had already
secured of the railway carriage. He looked
at the clock. Twenty minutes before he
started. He seemed to consider something
for a moment, looking critically at the old
lady while he did so.</p>

<p>“Cannot I persuade you to give me your
address in Hampshire?” He coughed a
little. “Have you your glycerine lozenges
with you?” she asked hurriedly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he answered, “they are in my
pocket. I will write to you, Mrs. Baines;
I may have something of importance to say.”</p>

<p>“Everything that you say is important,”
she answered nervously.</p>

<p>He got into the train and sat down.</p>

<p>“I am tired,” he said; “you must excuse
me for not standing any longer.” He
shivered as he opened the window. “I dislike
third class,” he added, “but I go by it
on principle; I am not rich enough to travel
by any other, Mrs. Baines,” and he looked at
her fixedly.</p>

<p>She was silent, she seemed fascinated, she
looked at him for a moment and winked
absently; then a thought seemed to strike
her and she started.</p>

<p>“Wait!” she exclaimed; “I will return in
a moment,” and she hurried away.</p>

<p>In five minutes she came back breathless
with excitement. “I have taken a great
liberty,” she said humbly, “but you must
forgive me. I have ventured to get you
this ticket; will you please me by changing
into a first-class carriage? You must
imagine that you are my guest,” and she
looked at him anxiously. “The guard is
waiting——”</p>

<p>“I cannot refuse you anything, Mrs.
Baines.” And with a chastened air he
pulled his portmanteau from under the seat.
The guard was waiting outside for it, and
took it to an empty carriage. Mr. Wimple
followed, Aunt Anne carrying the papers.
He took his place and looked round satisfied.
The guard touched his hat to the old lady
and went his way. Mrs. Baines gave a sigh
of satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Now I shall feel content, and you will
not be disturbed,” she added triumphantly.
“I have spoken——” She stopped, for his
hacking cough came back; she seemed to
shrink with pain as she heard it.</p>

<p>“I am quite an invalid,” he said impressively.</p>

<p>“I wish I were going with you to nurse
you.”</p>

<p>“I need nursing, Mrs. Baines,” he answered
sadly. “I need a great many things.”</p>

<p>“I wish I could give them to you.”</p>

<p>He looked at her curiously; as if the
words came from him without his knowledge,
he said suddenly, “I see Sir William
Rammage is a little better.”</p>

<p>“I am going to inquire after him this
morning,” she answered, and then she drew
a little parcel from beneath her shawl. “I
want you to put this into your pocket,” she
said, “and to open it by-and-by; it is only
a trifling proof that I thought of you as I
came along.”</p>

<p>“I always think of you,” he said, almost
reproachfully, as, without a word of thanks,
he put the parcel out of sight.</p>

<p>“Not more than I do of you,” she said,
in a low choking voice. “I hear you cough
in my sleep; and it grieves me to think how
hard you have to work.”</p>

<p>“I can’t take care of myself,” he said; “I
was always careless, Mrs. Baines, and I must
work. Fisher is a very fidgety man to work
for; it has taken me three days to review
a small book on American law, and even now
I am not sure that he will be satisfied.”</p>

<p>His voice never varied, the expression of
his eyes never changed save once for a
moment. She had taken off her gloves and
was resting her hands, thin and dry, on the
ledge of the carriage window while she leant
forward to talk to him, and suddenly he
looked down at them. They seemed to
repel him, he drew back a very little; she
saw the movement and followed his eyes;
she understood perfectly; for she had quick
insight, and courage to face unflinchingly
even truths that were not pleasant. She
drew her hands away and rubbed them softly
one over the other, as if by doing so she
could put young life into them. Suddenly
with a jerk the train moved.</p>

<p>“Good-bye,” she said excitedly. “Good-bye;
if I write to the address in town will
the letter be forwarded?”</p>

<p>But he could only nod. In a moment he
was out of sight. He did not lean forward
to look after her, he sat staring into space.
“She must be seventy,” he said. “I
wonder——” Then he felt in his pocket
for the third-class ticket he no longer needed.
“Probably they will return the amount I
paid for it.” A sudden thought struck him.
He looked at the ticket Mrs. Baines had
given him. “It is for Portsmouth,” he said
grimly. The one he had taken himself had
been for Liphook.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER VIII.</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><img class='dropcap' src='images/capi.jpg' style='float:left;width:5%;' alt='I'/>t</span> was not at all a bad thing to do,
Florence thought, as she sat and considered
the arrangement Mr. Fisher had so
suddenly made in regard to the house in town
and the cottage at Witley. The country
would do the children good, and Aunt Anne
would probably enjoy it. Of course the latter
would consent to go with them. Indeed,
she had clearly no other resource. Florence
wondered if she would like it.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Baines was so full of news herself
when she returned that she had no time
to listen to any one else.</p>

<p>“My love,” she said, “I have passed a
most important day.”</p>

<p>“Relate your adventures, Aunt Anne.”
But at this request Mrs. Baines winked and
spoke slowly.</p>

<p>“I had an engagement in the morning,”
she began, and hesitated. “When I had
fulfilled it,” she went on, “I thought it right,
Florence, to go and call on Sir William
Rammage. He has been ill, and I wanted
to assure him of my sympathy. Besides, I
felt that it was due to you—that it was an
imperative duty on my part to ask him for
an allowance, and that it was his duty to give
it to me.”</p>

<p>“But, Aunt Anne——”</p>

<p>“Yes, my love. I am living now on your
generous kindness; don’t think that I am
insensible to it. But for your tenderness,
my darling, I should have been alone in a
little lodging now, as I was when—when I
was first left a widow.”</p>

<p>“I should not like to think of you in a
little lodging, Aunt Anne,” Florence said
gently; and then she added gaily, “but continue
your adventures.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Baines gave a long sigh, and was
silent for a moment. She sat down on the
easy-chair and, as if she had not heard
Florence’s interruption, went on with a
strange tragic note in her voice—</p>

<p>“I never told you about that time,
Florence. I had three pounds in the world
when I came to London; just three pounds
to maintain my position until I could find
something to do. I had a little room at
Kilburn—a little room at the top of the
house; and I used to sit day after day,
week after week, waiting. I had no coals,
only a little spirit-lamp by which I made
some water hot, then poured it into a jug
and covered it over and warmed my hands
by it; it was often an hour before it grew
cold, my love.”</p>

<p>“But why did you not come to us?”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t,” the old lady answered in an
obstinate tone. “I felt that it would not be
treating you properly to present myself before
you while I was so poor and miserable”—she
paused and looked into the fire for a
moment, then suddenly went on: “The
woman at the corner where I went every
morning to buy a newspaper, saw that I was
poor, and presumed upon it. Once she said
I looked nipped up, and asked me to sit down
and get warm. I reproved her for familiarity,
and never went to the shop again.”</p>

<p>“But perhaps she meant it for kindness?”</p>

<p>“She should have remembered her position,
my love, and asked me in a different
manner. There is nothing more painful to
bear than the remembrance of one’s own
rank in life when one has to encounter the
hardships that belong by right to a lower
class.” Aunt Anne paused again for a
moment, and gave a long sigh before she
went on: “We won’t go over it, my dear.
If Mrs. North had shown less levity in her
conduct and more consideration to me, I
should have been there still instead of living
on your charity.”</p>

<p>“Oh no, Aunt Anne.”</p>

<p>“Yes, my love, it is so; even though you
love me and I love you, it is charity; and I
felt it keenly when you resented my little
offering of cream this morning—you, to
whom I would give everything I possess.”</p>

<p>“Oh no, Aunt Anne——” interrupted
Florence.</p>

<p>“And so—and so,” continued the old lady
with a little gasp, “I went to Sir William
Rammage once more. I told him—I told
him”—she stopped—“I told him how our
mothers had stood over us together, years
and years ago.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” Florence said soothingly.
She had heard this so often before. “I
hope he was good to you?”</p>

<p>“My dear, he listened with compunction,
but he saw the force of what I said. He
will write and tell me how much he will
allow me,” she added simply.</p>

<p>“I am very glad, Aunt Anne; I hope he
will write soon, and be generous. I know it
will make you happier.”</p>

<p>“It will, indeed,” and Mrs. Baines gave
another long sigh. “I shall not be dependent
on any one much longer.”</p>

<p>“Except upon him,” Florence said unwittingly.</p>

<p>“No, I shall not feel that I am dependent
even upon him,” and she looked up quickly.
“He will give it and I shall take it for the
honour of the family. I told him how impossible
it was that I could go on living upon
you and Walter, that it would be a disgrace.
I could not live upon him either. He has
shown me so little sympathy, my love, that
I could not endure it. I shall take the
allowance from him as I should take an
inheritance, knowing that it is not given to
me for my own sake. I could not take it in
any other spirit; but it would be as wrong in
him to forget what is due to us, as it would
be in me to let him do so. It would shed
dishonour on his name.”</p>

<p>And again she was silent; she seemed to
be living over the past, to be groping her
way back among days that were over before
Florence was even born, to be seeing people
whose very names had not been heard for
years.</p>

<p>“They would rise in their graves if I were
left to starve,” she continued; “I have always
felt it; and it was but right towards them
that I should go to William; it was due to
them even that I should live on you and
Walter, my darling, till I received an adequate
income.”</p>

<p>Suddenly her voice changed again, the
wonderful smile came back—the happy look
that always seemed as if it had travelled
from the youth she had left long years
behind.</p>

<p>“You understand, my love?” she asked.
“Bless you for all your kindness, but I am
not going to intrude upon you much longer.
I have already seen an apartment that will,
I think, suit my requirements.”</p>

<p>“Oh no.”</p>

<p>“Yes, my love, it will be much better.
You cut me to the quick this morning,
Florence,” and her voice grew sad; “you
said that you would have to send away your
dear children because my influence would
spoil them.”</p>

<p>“Aunt Anne!”—Florence began in consternation.</p>

<p>“Yes, dear, yes,” the old lady said
solemnly; “it gave me the deepest pain, as
I sat and thought it over in the privacy of
my own chamber. But when I came downstairs
and you shared your dear mother’s gift
with me, I knew that you loved me sincerely.”</p>

<p>“I do,” said Florence, soothingly.</p>

<p>“I am sure of it, my darling,” with even
more solemnity, “but it will be better that I
should take an apartment. It will rejoice
your tender heart to know that by your gift
you have helped me to secure one, and when
I receive my allowance from Sir William I
shall feel that I am independent once more.
You must forgive me, my love; it is not
that I do not appreciate your hospitality—yours
and Walter’s—I do. But I feel that
it would sadden all my dear ones who are
gone, if they knew that I was alone in the
world, without a home of my own. That
is why I went to Sir William Rammage,
Florence; and though he said little, I feel
sure that he saw the matter in a proper light,
and felt as I do about it.”</p>

<p>“What did he say?”</p>

<p>“He said he would think it over, and
when he had made up his mind he would
write to me. My love, would you permit
me to ring the bell?”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course. Why do you always ask
me? Don’t you feel at home here, dear
Aunt Anne?” Florence asked, thinking that
Sir William’s answer had, after all, committed
him to little.</p>

<p>“I hope I shall never so far forget myself
as not to treat you with the courtesy that
you have a right to expect, my darling. I
will never take advantage of our relationship.—Jane,”
she said, with quite another manner,
and in a cold and slightly haughty tone, to
the servant who had entered, “would you
have the goodness to divest me of my cloak?
and if your mistress gives you permission,
perhaps you would carry it up to my room?”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am,” said Jane, respectfully, but
without much willingness in her manner.
The servants had learnt to resent the tone
in which Mrs. Baines usually spoke to them.
“She treats us like dirt,” the housemaid
explained to the cook; “and if were made
of dirt, I should like to know what she’s
made of? She give me a shilling the other
day, and another time a new apron done up
in a box from the draper’s; but I don’t care
about her for all her presents. I know she
always sees every speck of dust that others
would be blind to; it’s in her wink that she
does.”</p>

<p>“And now that you have told me all
your news, I want you to listen to mine,”
Florence said.</p>

<p>Then she gave an account of Mr. Fisher’s
visit, and of the letting of the house for a
couple of months.</p>

<p>“So, Aunt Anne,” she continued triumphantly,
“I want you to be very, very good,
and to go with the children and two of the
servants to the cottage at Witley to-morrow,
and to be the mistress of the great establishment,
if you will, and mother to the children
till I come; that proves how bad I think
your influence is for them, doesn’t it, you
unkind old dear?”—and she stooped and
kissed Mrs. Baines.</p>

<p>Aunt Anne was delighted, and consented
at once.</p>

<p>“I shall never forget your putting this
confidence in me. You have proved your
affection for me most truly,” she said. “My
dear Florence, your children shall have the
most loving care that it is in my power to
give them. I will look after everything till
you come; more zealously than you yourself
could. Tell me, love, where do you say the
cottage is situated?”</p>

<p>“It is near Witley, it is on the direct
Portsmouth road; a sweet little cottage with
a garden, and fir woods stretching on either
side.”</p>

<p>“And how far is it from Portsmouth, my
love?” Mrs. Baines asked eagerly.</p>

<p>Florence divined the meaning of the question
instantly.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know, Aunt Anne; after
Witley comes Hindhead, and then Liphook,
and then Petersfield, and then—then I don’t
know. Liphook is the place where Mr.
Wimple”—the old lady winked to herself—“has
friends, and sometimes goes to stay.”</p>

<p>“And how far is that?”</p>

<p>“About six miles, I think—six or seven.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, my love; and now, if you
will allow me, I will retire. I must make
preparations for my journey, which is indeed
a delightful anticipation.”</p>

<p>Florence never forgot the October morning
on which she took Aunt Anne and the children
to Witley. They went from Waterloo.
She thought of Walter and the day they had
spent at Windsor, and of that last one on
which they had gone together to Southampton,
and she had returned alone. “Oh, my
darling,” she said to herself, “may you grow
well and strong, and come back to us soon
again.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Baines, too, seemed full of memories.
She looked up and down the platform; she
stood for a moment dreamily by the bookstall
before it occurred to her to buy a cheap
illustrated paper to amuse Catty and Monty
on the journey.</p>

<p>“My love,” she said to Florence, with
a little sigh, “a railway station is fraught
with many recollections of meeting and
parting——”</p>

<p>“And meeting again,” said Florence, longingly
thinking of Walter.</p>

<p>“Yes, my love,” the old lady answered
tenderly; “and may yours with your dear
one be soon.”</p>

<p>There were three miles to drive from
Witley to the cottage. A long white road,
with fir woods on either side. Gaps in the
firs, and glimpses of the Surrey hills, distant
and blue, of hanging woods and deep valleys.
The firs came to an end; and there were
cliffs of gravel full of the holes of sand-martins.
More woods, then hedges of blackberry-bushes,
bare enough now; gorse full of
late bloom, heather faded and turning from
russet to black. Here and there a solitary
house, masses of oak and larch and fir,
patches of sunshine, long wastes of shade;
and the road going on and on.</p>

<p>“Here we are at last,” Florence said, as
they stopped before a red-brick cottage that
stood only a few yards back from the road.
On either side of it was a fir plantation.
There was a gravel pathway round the
house, but the other paths were covered
with tan. Behind stretched a wilderness of
garden almost entirely uncultivated. There
was a little footway that wound through it
in and out among beeches and larches and
firs and oaks, and stopped at last on the
ridge of a dip that could hardly be called a
valley.</p>

<p>“Sometimes,” said Florence, as they
walked about, half an hour later, while the
servants were busy within, “we go down the
dip and up the other side, and so get over
to Hindhead. It is nearer than going there
by the road.”</p>

<p>“Our house is over there,” the children said.</p>

<p>“Their house,” explained Florence, “is a
little, lonely, thatched shed, half a mile away.
We don’t know who made it. It is in a
lovely part on the other side of the dip,
among the straggling trees. Perhaps some
one tethered a cow in it once. The children
call it their house now, because one day they
had tea there. After I return next week
we must try and walk across to it.”</p>

<p>But the old lady’s eyes were turned towards
the distance.</p>

<p>“And the road in front of the house,” she
asked, “where does that go to?”</p>

<p>“It winds round the Devil’s Punch Bowl,
and over Hindhead, and on through Liphook
and Petersfield to Portsmouth.”</p>

<p>Aunt Anne did not answer, she looked
still more intently into the distance, and gave
a long sigh.</p>

<p>“It is most exhilarating to be out of
London again, my dear Florence,” she said.
“I sincerely trust it will prove beneficial to
your dear ones. I was born in the country,
and I hope that some day I shall die in it.
London is most oppressive after a time.”</p>

<p>“I like London,” Florence answered;
“still it does now and then feel like a
prison.”</p>

<p>“And the rows and rows of houses are
the prison bars, my love. May we enter the
cottage?” she asked suddenly. She was
evidently tired; she stooped, and looked
older and more worn than usual.</p>

<p>“Poor old dear,” Florence thought. “I
hope she is not worrying about Madame
Celestine’s bill, and that she will soon hear
from Sir William Rammage. Then she will
be happier.”</p>

<p>It was a little house, simple inside as well
as out, with tiny rooms, plainly furnished.
The dining-room had been newly done up,
with cretonne curtains and a dado, and a
buttery-hatch in which Florence took a
certain pride as something rather grand for
so small a place. The drawing-room was
old-fashioned; a stiff roomy sofa with hard
flat cushions at one end; at the other a sweet
jangling piano. There were corner cupboards
with china bowls of pot-pourri on
them; on either side of the fireplace a
gaunt, high-backed easy-chair, and on the
left of each chair an old-fashioned screen on
which was worked a peacock. Aunt Anne
stopped on the threshold.</p>

<p>It seemed to Florence as if the room
recognized the old lady, as if it had been
waiting, knowing that she would come.
There was something about it that said more
plainly than any words could have said that
the hands were still that had first arranged
it, and many footsteps had gone out from its
doorway that would never come in at it
more.</p>

<p>“It always depresses me,” Florence explained;
“but it is just as we found it. We
refurnished the dining-room, and sit there a
good deal. It is more cheerful than this.
Come upstairs”—and she led the way.</p>

<p>The bedrooms were all small too, save
one in front, that seemed to match the drawing-room.
It looked like a room to die in:
Florence thought so, as she entered it for
the first time with Aunt Anne. A quaint
four-post bedstead with dark chintz curtains,
a worm-eaten bureau, a sampler worked in
Berlin wool and framed in black cherry-wood
hanging over the fireplace.</p>

<p>“This is the best room,” she said, “and
we keep it for visitors. There is a little one,
meant to be a dressing-room, I suppose,
leading out of it,” and she went to a bright
little nook with a bed in it. “I always feel
that the best bedroom and the drawing-room
belong to a past world, and the rest of the
house to the present one.”</p>

<p>“It is like your life and mine, my darling;
mine to the past and yours to the
present.”</p>

<p>“I think you ought to sleep in the best
room, Aunt Anne.”</p>

<p>“No, my love,” the old lady interrupted,
“let me have this little one which is next it.
When you require the other, if I am still
with you, I can lock the door between. The
best one is too grand for me; but sometimes
while it is empty I will go in, if you
have no objection, and look out at the fir
trees and the road that stretches right and
left——”</p>

<p>“I like doing that,” Florence interrupted.
“It always sets me thinking—the road from
the city to the sea.”</p>

<p>“From the city to the sea,” the old lady
repeated; “from the voices to the silences.”</p>

<p>“Aunt Anne, we mustn’t grow sentimental,”
Florence began. There was the sound of
a tinkling bell. It seemed to come at an
opportune moment. “Oh, happy sound,”
she laughed; “it means that our meal is
ready. Catty, darling,” she called, “Monty,
my son, roast chicken is waiting downstairs.
Auntie and mummy are quite ready; come,
dear babes”—and patter, patter, came the
sound of the little feet, and together they all
went down.</p>

<p>An hour later the fly came to the door;
it was time for Florence to start on her way
back to town.</p>

<p>“I shall be with you at latest on Tuesday.
Perhaps, dear Aunt Anne, if you don’t mind
taking care of the bad children so long, I
may go on Saturday for a day or two to
an old schoolfellow,” she said. “Then I
should not be here till the middle of next
week.”</p>

<p>“Dear child, you do indeed put confidence
in me,” Mrs. Baines answered quaintly.</p>

<p>“And, Aunt Anne, I have ordered most
things in, but the tradespeople come every day
if there is anything more you want. What
you order is, of course, put down, but here
is some money for odds and ends. Four
pounds, I think, will carry you through; and
here is a little book in which to put down
your expenses. I always keep a most careful
account of what I spend; you don’t mind
doing so either, do you?”</p>

<p>“My love, anything you wish will be a
pleasure to me.”</p>

<p>“If you please, ma’am,” said Jane, entering,
“the driver says you must start at once
if you want to catch this train.”</p>

<p>“Then good-bye, dear Aunt Anne; good-bye,
dear dickie-birds; be happy together.
You shall see me very soon again; send me
a letter every other day;” and with many
embraces Florence was allowed to get out
of the door. But Aunt Anne and the
children ran excitedly after her to the gate,
and helped her into the little waggonette,
and kissed their hands and waved their
handkerchiefs as she drove off, and called
“Good-bye, good-bye;” and so, watching
them, Florence went along the white road
towards the station.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER IX.</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><img class='dropcap' src='images/capt.jpg' style='float:left;width:5%;' alt='T'/>he</span> days that followed were busy ones
for Florence—busy in a domestic
sense, so that the history of them does not
concern us here. Mr. Fisher called one afternoon;
by a strange coincidence it was while
Ethel Dunlop was helping Florence with an
inventory of china. Miss Dunlop readily
promised to visit his mother, but she did not
show any particular interest in the editor.</p>

<p>“He has been so kind,” Florence said,
“and don’t you think he is very agreeable?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes; but you know, Florrie dear, he
has a very square jaw.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“It is a good thing he never married
again; he would have been very obstinate.”</p>

<p>“But why do you say never did?—as if
he never would. He is only forty-odd.”</p>

<p>“Only forty-odd!” laughed Ethel—“only
a million. If a man is over eight-and-twenty
he might as well be over eighty; it is mere
modesty that he is not.”</p>

<p>“Walter is over thirty, and just as fascinating
as ever.”</p>

<p>Florence was rather indignant.</p>

<p>“Ah, yes, but he is married, and married
men take such a long time to grow old. By
the way, Mr. Fisher said something about
a theatre-party, when his mother is here.
Do you think I might ask him to invite
George Dighton as well? George is very
fond of theatres.”</p>

<p>Before Florence could reply, a carriage
stopped at the door; it looked familiar, it
reminded her of Aunt Anne in her triumphant
days. But a strange lady descended from
it now, and was shown upstairs to the drawing-room,
in which Aunt Anne had sat and
related her woes and known her triumphs.</p>

<p>“Mrs. North, ma’am,” said the servant;
and then Florence understood.</p>

<p>She left Ethel in the dining-room with
the inventory, and went up to receive the
visitor. Mrs. North was as pretty as Aunt
Anne had declared her to be; a mere girl
to look at, tall and slim. Florence thought
it was quite natural that her husband should
like her to have a chaperon.</p>

<p>“I came to see Mrs. Baines,” she said,
coming forward in a shy, hesitating manner,
“but hearing that she was in the country I
ventured to ask for you. What have you done
with the dear old lady?” and she laughed
nervously. Florence looked at her, fascinated
by her beauty; by her clothes, that seemed
to be a mixture of fur and lace and perfume,
by the soft brown hair that curled low on
her forehead, by the sweet blue eyes—by
every bit of her. “She told you, probably,
that she was very angry when she left me;
I know it has all been very dreadful in her
eyes; but she was always kind to me, and
I thought by this time that she would,
perhaps, forgive me and make it up; so I
came.” She said it with a penitent air.</p>

<p>“I am afraid she is very angry,” Florence
answered, laughing, for the pretty woman
before her did not seem like a stranger.
“Do you want her again?”</p>

<p>“Oh no!” and Mrs. North shook her
head emphatically. “She would not come,
I know; besides, it would be impossible:
she led us a terrible life. But we loved her,
and wanted just to make it up with her
again. I think we could have put up with
anything if she had not quarrelled with the
servants.”</p>

<p>“I was afraid it was that,” Florence
answered.</p>

<p>“Oh yes!” sighed Mrs. North; “she was
horribly autocratic with them—‘autocratic’
is her own word. At last she quarrelled
with Hetty, and wanted me to send her
away—to send away Hetty, who is a born
treasure, and cooks like an angel. It would
have broken our hearts—a woman who sends
up a dinner like a charm; we couldn’t let her
go, it was impossible, and the old lady fled.”</p>

<p>“I am very sorry. You were so kind to
her; she always said that.”</p>

<p>“I loved her,” Mrs. North answered, with
a little sigh. “She was so like my dear dead
mother grown old—that was the secret of her
attraction for us; but she ruled us with a
rod of iron that grew more and more unyielding
every day. And yet she was very
kind. She was always giving us presents.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes,” Florence said, in a despairing
voice.</p>

<p>“We have had the bills for them since,”
Mrs. North went on, with a comical air.
“She used to say that I was very frivolous,”
she added suddenly. “She thought it wicked
of me to enjoy life while my husband was
away. But he is old, Mrs. Hibbert; one
may have an affection for an old husband,
but one can’t be in love with him.”</p>

<p>“If she were very nice she would not have
made that remark to me, whom she never
saw before,” Florence thought, beginning to
dislike her a little.</p>

<p>“Of course I am sorry he is away,” Mrs.
North said, as if she perfectly understood
the impression she was making; “he is
coming back now. He has telegraphed
suddenly.” There was something like fright
in her voice as she said it. “I did not
expect him; but he is coming almost directly.
I suppose I ought to be very glad,” she
added, with a ghostly smile. “I am, of
course; but I am surprised at his sudden
return. I took Mrs. Baines because he
wished me to have an old lady about me;
but I wanted my own way. I liked her to
have hers when it amused me to see her
have it, when it didn’t I wanted to have
mine.” Mrs. North’s whole expression had
altered again, and she looked up with two
blue eyes that fascinated and repelled, and
laughed a merry, uncontrolled laugh like a
child’s. “Oh, she was very droll.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it is very rude of me to say it,”
Florence said primly, for deep in her heart
there was a great deal of primness, “but I
can understand Mr. North wishing you to
have a chaperon; you are very young to be
left alone.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, and very careless, I know that.
And Mrs. Baines used to provoke me into
shocking her. I could shock her so easily,
and did—don’t you know how one loves
power for good or ill over a human being?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t,” Florence answered, a little
stiffly.</p>

<p>“I do; I love it best of all things in the
world, whether it leads me uphill or downhill.
But I am intruding,” for she saw a set
cold look coming over Florence’s face. “Let
me tell you why I asked for you. I have
been so embarrassed about Mrs. Baines.
She gave us presents, and she bought all
sorts of things: but she didn’t pay for them.
These bills came, and the people wanted
their money.” She pulled a little roll out of
her pocket. “She probably forgot them,
and I thought it would be better to pay
them, especially as I owed her some money
when she left which she would not take;”
and she laughed out again, but there was
the odd sound like fright in her voice.
“They are from florists and all sorts of
people.”</p>

<p>Florence looked over the bills quickly and
almost guiltily. There were the pots of fern
and the flowers that had been sent to her
and the children after Aunt Anne’s first
visit; and there were the roses with which
she had triumphantly entered on the night
of the dinner-party. “Oh, poor old lady!”
she exclaimed sadly.</p>

<p>“They are paid,” Mrs. North said. “Don’t
be distressed about them and many others—lace-handkerchiefs,
shoes, all sorts of things.
Don’t tell her. She would think I had taken
a liberty or committed a solecism,” and she
made a little wry face. “But what I really
wanted to see you about, Mrs. Hibbert, was
Madame Celestine’s bill. I am afraid I can’t
manage that all by myself; it is too long.
Madame Celestine, of course, is sweetly
miserable, for she thinks the old lady has
vanished into space. She came to me yesterday.
It seems that she went to you a
few days ago, but you were out, and she
was glad of it when she discovered that Mrs.
Baines was your aunt, for she doesn’t want
to offend you. She came to me again to-day.
She is very miserable. I believe it
will turn her hair grey. Oh, it is too
funny.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think it is at all funny.”</p>

<p>“But indeed it is, for I don’t believe Mrs.
Baines will ever be able to pay the fifteen
pounds; in fact, we know that she won’t.
Probably it is worrying her a good deal. I
have been wondering whether something
could not be done; if you and I, for instance,
were to arrange it between us.”</p>

<p>“You are very good, Mrs. North,”
Florence said, against her will.</p>

<p>“Oh no, but I am sorry for her, and it
vexes and worries me to think that she is
annoyed. I want to get rid of that vexation,
and will pay something to do so. That is
what most generosity comes to,” Mrs. North
went on, with mock cynicism, “the purchase
of a pleasant feeling for one’s self, or the
getting rid of an unpleasant one. There is
little really unselfish goodness in the world,
and when one meets it, as a rule, it isn’t
charming, it isn’t fascinating; one feels that
one would rather be without it.” She rose
as she spoke. “Well,” she asked, “what
shall we do? I’ll pay one half of the old
lady’s bill if you will pay the other half.”</p>

<p>“You are very good,” Florence repeated,
wonderingly.</p>

<p>“No; but I expect you are,” and Mrs.
North showed two rows of little white teeth.
“I should think you are a model of virtue,”
she added, with an almost childlike air of
frankness, which made it impossible to take
offence at her words, though Florence felt
that at best she was only regarded as the
possessor of a quality that just before her
visitor had denounced.</p>

<p>“Why,” she asked, smiling against her
will, “do I look like a model of virtue?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, you are almost Madonna-like,”
Mrs. North said, with a sigh. “I wish I
were like you, only—only I think I should
get very tired of myself. I get tired now;
till a reaction comes. But a reaction to the
purely good must be tame at best.”</p>

<p>“You are very clever,” Florence said,
almost without knowing it, and shrinking
from her again.</p>

<p>“How do you know? My husband says
I am clever, but I don’t think I am. I am
alive. So many people are merely in the
preface to being alive, and never get any
farther. I am well in the middle of the
book; and I am eager, so eager, that sometimes
I long to eat up the whole world in
order to know the taste of everything. Do
you understand that?”</p>

<p>“No. I am content with my slice.”</p>

<p>“Ah, that is it. I am not content with
mine. You have your husband and children.”</p>

<p>“But you have a husband.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have a husband too; a funny old
husband, a long way off, who is rapidly—too
rapidly, I fear—coming nearer”—Florence
hated her—“and no children. I amused
myself with the old lady—Mrs. Baines—till
she fled from me. Now I try other things.
Good-bye.”</p>

<p>“Good-bye,” Florence said.</p>

<p>As Mrs. North was going out of the door
she turned and asked, “Have you many
friends—women friends?”</p>

<p>“Yes, a great many, thank you,” Mrs.
Hibbert said, with a little haughty inclination
of the head. The haughtiness seemed to
amuse Mrs. North, for the merry look came
over her face again, but only for a moment.</p>

<p>“I thought you had,” she answered. “I
have none; I don’t want them. Good-bye.”</p>

<p>It was nearly dark, and the one servant
left to help Florence get the house ready
had neglected to light the lamp on the
staircase. Mrs. North groped her way
down.</p>

<p>“I want to tell you something,” she said.
“You said just now that I was clever. I
don’t think I am, but I can divine people’s
thoughts pretty easily. You are very good,
I think; but consider this, your goodness is
of no use if you are not good to others; good
to women especially. The good of goodness
is that you can wrap others inside it. It
ought to be like a big cloak that you have
on a cold night, while the shivering person
next to you has none. If you don’t make
use of your goodness,” she went on with a
catch in her breath, “what is the good of
it?—I seem to be talking paradoxes—you
prove how beautiful it is, perhaps, but that is
all; you make it like the swan that sings its
own death-song. One listens and watches,
and goes away to think of things more comprehensible,
and to do them. Good-bye,
Mrs. Hibbert,” she said gently, and almost
as if she were afraid she held out her hand.
Florence took it, a little wonder-struck.
“You are like a Madonna, very like one, as
I said just now; but though you are older
than I am, I think I know more about
some things than you do—good and bad.
Madonnas never know the world very well.
Give my love to the old lady, and say I hope
she has forgiven me. I am going to Monte
Carlo the day after to-morrow, only for three
days, to brace myself up for my husband’s
return; tell her that too. It will shock her.
Say that I should like to have taken her,”
and with a last little laugh she went out—into
the darkness, it seemed to Florence.</p>

<p>But the next minute there were two
flashing lamps before the house; there was
the banging of a door, and Mrs. North was
driven away.</p>

<p>Florence went slowly back to the dining-room
and the inventory. Ethel Dunlop had
gone. She was glad of it, for she wanted to
think over her strange visitor.</p>

<p>“I don’t understand her,” she said to
herself. “She is unlike any one I ever met;
she fascinated and repelled me. I felt as if
I wanted to kiss her, and yet the touch of
her hand made me shiver.” Then she
thought of Madame Celestine’s bill, and of
Aunt Anne, and wished that the dress had
not been bought, especially for the dinner-party;
it made her feel as if she had been
the unwitting cause of Mrs. Baines’s extravagance.
She looked into the fire, and
remembered the events of that wonderful
evening, and thought of Walter away, and
the bills at home that would have to be paid
at Christmas. And she thought of her
winter cloak that was three years old and
shabby, and of the things she had longed to
buy for the children. Above all she thought
of the visions she had had of saving little by
little, and putting her savings away in a
very safe place, until she had a cosy sum
with which some day to give Walter a
pleasant surprise, and suggest that they
should go off together for “a little spree,”
as he would call it, to Paris or Switzerland.
The fire burnt low, the red coals grew dull,
the light from the street lamp outside seemed
to come searching into the room as though
it were looking for some one who was not
there. She thought of Walter’s letter safe
in her pocket. He himself was probably at
Malta by this time—getting stronger and
stronger in the sunshine. Dear Walter, how
generous he was; he too was a little bit
reckless sometimes. She wondered if he
inherited this last quality from Aunt Anne.
She thought of her children at Witley having
tea, most likely with cakes and jam in
abundance; and of Aunt Anne in her glory.
She wondered if Mr. Wimple had turned
up. “Poor Aunt Anne,” she sighed, and
there was a long bill in her mind. Presently
she rose, lighted a candle, drew down the
blind—shutting out the glare from the street
lamp—and going slowly to the writing-table
in the corner, unlocked it, opened a little
secret drawer, and looked in. There were
three five-pound notes there—the remainder
of her mother’s gift. “I wonder if Mrs.
North had Madame Celestine’s bill,” she
thought. “But it doesn’t matter; she said
it was fifteen pounds. I can send her the
amount.”</p>

<p>A couple of hours later, while she was in
the very act of putting a cheque into an
envelope, a note arrived. It had been left
by hand; it was scented with violets, and
ran thus:—</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“<span class='sc'>Dear Mrs. Hibbert</span>,</p>

<p>“I have ventured to pay Madame
Celestine. I determined to do so while I
was with you just now; but was afraid to
tell you, that was why I changed the conversation
so abruptly. Please don’t let the
old lady know that it is my doing, for she
might be angry; but she was very good to
me, and I am glad to do this for her. Forgive
all the strange things I said this afternoon,
and don’t trouble to acknowledge
this.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:5em;'>“Yours sincerely,</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;'>“<span class='sc'>E. North</span>.</p>

<p>“P.S.—I enclose receipt.”</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER X.</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><img class='dropcap' src='images/capi.jpg' style='float:left;width:5%;' alt='I'/>t</span> was not till Tuesday afternoon in the
week following that Florence went
back to Witley.</p>

<p>Mrs. Burnett was at the station, sitting in
a little governess-cart drawn by a donkey.</p>

<p>“I am waiting for my husband,” she explained;
“he generally comes by this train,
and I drive him home, donkey permitting.
It is a dear little donkey, and we are so fond
of him.”</p>

<p>“A dear little cart too,” Florence answered
as she stood by its side, talking. “I have
been hoping that you would come and see
me, Mrs. Burnett; we are going to be here
for six or seven weeks.”</p>

<p>“I know, Mr. Fisher told me,” Mrs.
Burnett replied in her sweet and rather
intense voice, “and we are so sorry that
your visit takes place just while we are
away. I am going to Devonshire to-morrow
morning to stay with my mother while my
husband goes to Scotland. I am so-o sorry,”—she
had a way of drawing out her words
as if to give them emphasis. Florence liked
to look at Mrs. Burnett’s eyes while she
spoke, they always seemed to attest that
every word she said expressed the absolute
meaning and intention in her mind. Her
listeners gained a sense of restfulness which
comes from being in the presence of a real
person from whom they might take bitter or
sweet, certain of its reality. “I hoped from
Mr. Fisher’s note that you had arrived
before, and ventured to call on Saturday.”</p>

<p>“Did you see Mrs. Baines?”</p>

<p>“Only for a moment. What a charming
old lady—such old-fashioned courtesy; it
was like being sent back fifty years to listen
to her. She wanted me to stay, but I refused,
for she was just setting off for a drive
with your children and her nephew.”</p>

<p>“Setting off for a drive?” Florence
repeated.</p>

<p>“Yes, she had Steggall’s waggonette from
the Blue Lion, and was going to Guildford
shopping. She said she meant to buy some
surprises for you.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Florence meekly, and her
heart sank. “Did you say that she had a
nephew with her?”</p>

<p>“Well, I supposed it was a nephew, unless
she has a son—a tall fair young man, who
looks delicate, and walks as if his legs were
not very strong.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, I know,” Florence answered, as
she signed to the fly she had engaged to
come nearer to the donkey-cart, so that she
might not waste a minute. “He is a friend;
he is no relation. Good-bye, Mrs. Burnett;
I am sorry you are going away. I suppose
you are waiting for the fast train, as Mr.
Burnett did not come by the last one?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is due in twenty minutes. Good-bye;
so sorry not to have been at home
during your visit. Oh, Mrs. Hibbert, do
you think your children would like to have
the use of this cart while we are away?
The donkey is so gentle and so good.”</p>

<p>“It is too kind of you to think of it,”
Florence began, beaming; for she thought
of how Catty and Monty would shout for
joy at having a donkey-cart to potter about
in. And in her secret soul, though she felt
it would not do to betray it, she was nearly
as much pleased as they would be: she
often had an inward struggle for the dignity
with which she felt her matronly position
should be supported.</p>

<p>“It will be such a pleasure to lend it them.
It’s a dear little donkey, so good and gentle.
It doesn’t go well,” Mrs. Burnett added, in
an apologetic tone; “but it’s a dear little
donkey, and does everything else well.”
And over this remark Florence pondered
much as she drove away.</p>

<p>When she came in sight of the cottage she
wondered if she had been absent more than
half an hour, or at all. She had left it in
the afternoon more than a week ago, and
the children had stood out in the roadway
dancing and waving their handkerchiefs till
she could see them no longer. As she came
back, they stood there dancing and waving
their handkerchiefs again. They shouted
for joy as she got out of the fly.</p>

<p>“Welcome, my darling, welcome,” cried
Aunt Anne, who was behind them, by the
gate. “These dear children and I have
been watching more than an hour for you.
Enter your house, my love. It is indeed a
privilege to be here to receive you.”</p>

<p>“It is a privilege to come back to so warm
a welcome,” Florence said when, having
embraced her children and Aunt Anne, she
was allowed to enter the cottage; “and how
comfortable and nice it looks!” she exclaimed,
as she stopped by the dining-room
doorway. There was a wood fire blazing,
and the tea set out, and the water in the
silver kettle singing, and hot cakes in a
covered dish in the fender. Flowers set off
the table, and in the pots about the room
were boughs of autumn leaves. It was all
cosy and inviting, and wore a festival air—festival
that Florence knew had been made
for her. She turned and kissed the old lady
gratefully. “Dear Aunt Anne,” she said,
and that was thanks enough.</p>

<p>“I thought, my love, that you would like
to partake of tea with your dear children on
your return. Your later evening meal I have
arranged to be a very slender one.”</p>

<p>“But you are too good, Aunt Anne.”</p>

<p>“It is you who have been too good to me,”
the old lady answered tenderly. “And now,
my darling, let me take you up to your
chamber; it is ready for your reception.”</p>

<p>There was a triumphant note in her voice
that prepared Florence for the fire in the
grate and the bouquet on the dressing-table,
and all the little arrangements that Mrs.
Baines had devised to add to her comfort.
It was very cheery, she thought when she
was alone; Aunt Anne had a knack of
making one enjoy a home-coming. She sat
for a few moments over the fire, and pulled
out Walter’s letter and read it and kissed it
and put it back into her pocket. Then she
looked round the cosy room again, and
noticed a little packet on the corner of the
drawers. Aunt Anne must have placed it
there when she went out of the room. On
it was written, <span class='it'>For my darling Florence</span>.
“Oh,” she said, “it’s another present,” and
regretfully her fingers undid the string.
Inside the white paper was a little pin-cushion
covered with blue velvet, and having round
it a rim of silver filigree work. Attached
to it was a little note which ran thus—</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“<span class='sc'>My Darling</span>,—Accept this token of my
love and gratitude. I feel that there is no
way in which I can better prove how much
I appreciated your generous gift to me than
by spending a portion of it on a token of my
affection for you. I trust you will honour my
little gift with your acceptance.”</p>

</div>

<p>“Oh,” said Florence again, in despair,
“I wonder if she has once thought of Madame
Celestine’s bill or the others. What is the
good of giving her money if one gets it back
in the shape of presents?”</p>

<p>But she could not bear to treat the old
lady’s generosity with coldness. So Aunt
Anne was thanked, and the cushion admired,
and a happy little party gathered round the
tea-table.</p>

<p>“And have you had any visitors except
Mrs. Burnett?” Florence asked artfully,
when the meal was over.</p>

<p>“We have had Mr. Wimple,” Aunt Anne
said; “he is far from well, my love, and is
trying to recruit at Liphook.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, he has friends there.”</p>

<p>“No, my love, not now. He is at present
lodging with an old retainer.”</p>

<p>“And have you been to see him?”</p>

<p>“No, dear Florence, he preferred that I
should not do so.”</p>

<p>“We took him lots of rides,” said Monty.</p>

<p>“And Aunt Anne gave him a present,”
said Catty, “and he put it into his pocket
and never looked at it. He didn’t know
what was inside the paper,—we did, didn’t
we, auntie?”</p>

<p>“My dear children,” Mrs. Baines said, “if
your mother will give you permission you
had better go into the nursery. It is past
your hour for bed, my dear ones.”</p>

<p>The children looked a little dismayed, but
did not dream of disobeying.</p>

<p>“Was it wrong to say you gave him a
present?” asked Catty, with the odd perception
of childhood, as she put up her face
to be kissed.</p>

<p>“My dears,” answered Aunt Anne,
sweetly, “in my day children did not talk
with their elders unless they were invited
to do so.”</p>

<p>“We didn’t know,” said Monty, ruefully.</p>

<p>“No, my darlings, I know that. Bless
you,” continued the old lady sweetly; “and
good night, my dear ones. Under your
pillows you will each find a chocolate which
auntie placed there for you this morning.”</p>

<p>“And did you enjoy the drives?” Florence
asked, when the children had gone.</p>

<p>“Yes, my dear, thank you.” Mrs. Baines
was silent for a moment. Then she raised
her head, and, as if she had gathered
courage, went on in a slightly louder tone,
“I thought it would do your dear children
good, Florence, to see the country, and,
therefore, I ventured to take them some
drives. Occasionally Mr. Wimple was so
kind as to accompany us.”</p>

<p>“And I hope they did him good, too,”
Florence said, trying not to betray her
amusement.</p>

<p>“Yes, my love, I trust they did.”</p>

<p>Then Florence remembered the bills paid
by Mrs. North. They were all in a sealed
envelope in her pocket, but she could not
gather the courage to deliver it. She wanted
to ask after Sir William Rammage, too, to
know whether he had written yet and settled
the question of an allowance; but for that,
also, her courage failed—the old lady always
resented questions. Then she remembered
Mr. Fisher’s remark about Alfred Wimple’s
writing, and thought it would please Aunt
Anne to hear of it.</p>

<p>“Mr. Fisher says that Mr. Wimple writes
very well; he has been doing some reviewing
for the paper.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Baines winked with satisfaction.</p>

<p>“I am quite sure he writes well, my love,”
she answered quickly; “he is a most accomplished
man.”</p>

<p>“And is there no more news to relate,
Aunt Anne?” Florence asked; “no more
doings during my absence?”</p>

<p>“No, my love, I think not.”</p>

<p>“Then I have some news for you. I
hope it won’t vex you, for I know you were
very angry with her. Mrs. North has been
to see me. She really came to see you, but
when she found you had gone out of town
she asked for me.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Baines looked almost alarmed and
very angry.</p>

<p>“It was most presumptuous of her,” she
exclaimed.</p>

<p>“But I don’t understand; why should it be
presumptuous?” Florence asked, astonished.</p>

<p>“She had no right; she had not my
permission.”</p>

<p>“But, dear Aunt Anne, she came to see
you; and why should it be presumptuous?”</p>

<p>“I should prefer not to discuss the subject.
I have expressed my opinion, and that
is sufficient,” Mrs. Baines said haughtily.
“I repeat that it was most presumptuous
of her, under the circumstances, to call
upon you—a liberty, a—Florence,” she
went on, with sudden alarm in her voice,
“I hope you did not promise to go and see
her.”</p>

<p>“She never asked me.”</p>

<p>“I should have put my veto on it if she
had. My dear, you must trust to my mature
judgment in some things. I know the world
better than you do. Believe me, I have my
reasons for every word I say. I treated
Mrs. North with the greatest clemency and
consideration, though she frequently forgot
not only what was due to herself, but what
was due to me. I was blind while I stayed
with her, Florence, and did not see many
things that I do now; for I am not prone to
think ill of any one. You know that, my
love, do you not? I must beg that you will
never, on any account, mention Mrs. North’s
name again in my presence.”</p>

<p>Florence felt as if the envelope would
burn a hole in her pocket. It was impossible
to deliver it now. Perhaps, after all, the
wisest way would be to say nothing about it.
She had an idea that Aunt Anne frequently
forgot all about her bills as soon as she had
come to the conclusion that it was impossible
to make them any longer. She searched
about in her mind for some other topic
of conversation. It was often difficult to
find a subject to converse upon with Aunt
Anne, for the old lady never suggested
one herself, and except of past experiences
and old-world recollections she seldom
seemed sufficiently interested to talk much.
Happily as it seemed for the moment, Jane
entered with the housekeeping books. They
were always brought in on a Tuesday, and
paid on a Wednesday morning. Florence
was very particular on this point. They
usually gave her a bad half-hour, for she
could never contrive to keep them down as
much as she desired. That week, however,
she reflected that they could not be very
bad; besides, she had left four pounds with
Aunt Anne, which must be almost intact,
unless the drives had been paid out of them;
but even then there would be plenty left to
more than cover the books. The prospect
of getting through her accounts easily cheered
her, and she thought that she would set
about them at once.</p>

<p>“They are heavy this week, ma’am,” Jane
said, not without a trace of triumph in her
voice, “on account of the chickens and the
cream and the company.”</p>

<p>“The chickens and the cream and the
company,” laughed Florence, as Jane went
out of the room; “it sounds like a line from
a comic poem. What does she mean?”</p>

<p>Aunt Anne winked as if to give herself
nerve.</p>

<p>“Jane was very impertinent to me one
day, my love, because I felt sure that after
the fatigue of the journey from town, and the
change of air, you would prefer that your
delicately-nurtured children should eat chicken
and have cream with their second course
every day for dinner, instead of roast mutton
and milk pudding. White meat is infinitely
preferable for delicate digestions.”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear Aunt Anne,” Florence said
sweetly, and she felt a sudden dread of opening
the books, “you are quite right.” But
what did a few chickens and a little cream
matter in comparison to the poor old lady’s
feelings? she thought. “And if you had
company too, of course you wanted to have
a smarter table. Whom have you been entertaining,
you dear and dissipated Aunt Anne?”</p>

<p>“My dear Florence, I have entertained
no one but Mr. Wimple. He is a friend
of yours and your dear Walter’s, and I tried
to prove to him that I was worthy to belong
to you, by showing him such hospitality as
lay in my power.”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear, and it was very kind of you,”
Florence said tenderly. After all, why
should Aunt Anne be worried through that
horrid Mr. Wimple? Walter would have
invited him if he had found him in the neighbourhood,
and why should not Aunt Anne
do so in peace, if it pleased her? Of course,
now that she herself had returned she could
do as she liked about him. She looked at the
books. They were not so very bad, after all.</p>

<p>“Shall we make up our accounts now,
and get it over, or in the morning?” she
asked.</p>

<p>“I should prefer the morning,” Aunt Anne
said meekly. “To-night, love, you must be
tired, and I am also fatigued with the excitement
consequent on seeing you.”</p>

<p>“What a shame, poor Aunt Anne!”
Florence said brightly. “I have worn you
out.”</p>

<p>“Only with happiness, my dear,” said the
old lady, fondly.</p>

<p>Florence put away her books, and stroked
Aunt Anne’s shoulder as she passed.</p>

<p>“We will do our work in the morning,”
she said.</p>

<p>“Yes, my darling, in the morning. In the
afternoon I may possibly have an engagement.”</p>

<p>Florence longed to ask where, but a certain
stiffness in Aunt Anne’s manner made it
impossible.</p>

<p>“Have you any news from London?”
she ventured to inquire, for she was longing
to know about Sir William Rammage.</p>

<p>“No, my love, I have no news from London,”
Mrs. Baines answered, and she evidently
meant to say no more.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p>In the morning much time was taken up
with the arrival of the donkey-cart and the
delight of the children. A great basket of
apples was inside the cart, and on the top
was a little note explaining that they were
from Mrs. Burnett’s garden, and she hoped
the children might like them. Aunt Anne
was as much pleased with the donkey as the
rest of the party.</p>

<p>“There is a rusticity in the appearance of
a donkey,” she explained, “that always gives
me a sense of being really in the country.”</p>

<p>“Not when you meet him in London, I
fear,” Florence said.</p>

<p>Mrs. Baines considered for a moment.
She seemed to resent the observation.</p>

<p>“No, my love, of course not in London;
I am speaking of the country,” she said
reprovingly; then she added, “I should
enjoy a little drive occasionally myself, if you
would trust me with the cart, my love. It
would remind me of days gone by. I sometimes
drove one at Rottingdean. You are
very fortunate, my dear one, in having so few
sorrows to remember—for I trust you have
few. It always saddens me to think of the
past. Let us go indoors.”</p>

<p>Florence put her arm through the old
lady’s, and led her in. Then she thought
of the books again; it would be a good time
to make them up.</p>

<p>“I am always particular about my accounts,
you know, Aunt Anne,” she said in an apologetic
tone.</p>

<p>“Yes, my love,” answered the old lady;
“I admire you for it.”</p>

<p>Florence looked at the figures; they made
her wince a little, but she said nothing.</p>

<p>“The bill for the waggonettes, Aunt
Anne?” she asked.</p>

<p>“That belongs to me, my dear.”</p>

<p>“Oh no, I can’t allow that.”</p>

<p>“My love, I made an arrangement with
Mr. Steggall, and that is sufficient.”</p>

<p>Again Aunt Anne’s tone forbade any discussion.
Florence felt sure that one day
Steggall’s bill would arrive, but she said
nothing.</p>

<p>“Do you mind giving me the change out
of the four pounds?” she asked, very gently.
Mrs. Baines went slowly over to her work-basket,
and took up a little dress she was
making for Catty.</p>

<p>“Not now, my love; I want to get on
with my work.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I could get your account-book,
Aunt Anne; then I should know how much
there is left.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Baines began to sew.</p>

<p>“I did not put anything down in the
account-book,” she said doggedly. “I considered,
dear Florence, that my time was
too valuable. It always seems to me great
nonsense to put down every penny one
spends.”</p>

<p>“It is a check on one’s self.”</p>

<p>“I do not wish to keep a check on myself,”
Mrs. Baines answered, scornfully.</p>

<p>“Could you tell me how much you have
left?” Florence asked meekly. “I hope
there may be enough to help us through
the week.”</p>

<p>She did not like to say that she thought
it must be nearly untouched.</p>

<p>“Florence,” burst out the old lady, with
the injured tone in her voice that Florence
knew so well, “I have but ten shillings left
in the world. If you wish to take it from
me you must do so; but it is not like you,
my darling.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Aunt Anne,” Florence began, bewildered,
“I am sure you—— I did not
mean—I did not know——”</p>

<p>“I’m sure you did not,” Mrs. Baines said,
with a sense of injury still in her voice,
“but there is nothing so terrible or so galling
to a sensitive nature like mine—and
your dear Walter’s takes after it, Florence,
I am sure—as to be worried about money
matters.”</p>

<p>“But, indeed, Aunt Anne, I only thought
that—that——” but here she stopped, not
knowing how to go on for a moment; “I
thought that perhaps the unpaid books represented
the household expenses,” she
added at last. Really, something must be
done to make the old lady careful, she
thought.</p>

<p>“My love,” Mrs. Baines said, with an
impatient shake of her head, “I cannot go
into the details of every little expense. I
am not equal to it. Everything you do not
find charged in the books has either been
paid, or will be charged, by my request, to
my private account, and you must leave it
so. I really cannot submit to being made
to give an explanation of every penny I
spend. I am not a child, Florence. I am
not an inexperienced girl; I had kept house
before, my love—if you will allow me to say
so—before you were born.” The treble note
had come into Aunt Anne’s voice; it was a
sign that tears were not far off.</p>

<p>But Florence could not feel as compassionate
as she desired. She smarted under
the loss of her money; there was nothing
at all to represent it, and Aunt Anne did not
seem to have the least idea that it had been
of any consequence. Florence got up and
put the books away, looking across at Aunt
Anne while she did so. The expression on
the old lady’s face was set, and almost
angry; her lips were firmly closed. She
was working at Catty’s little dress. She
was a beautiful needle-woman, and embroidered
cuffs and collars on the children’s
things that were a source of joyful pride to
their mother. But even the host of stitches
would not pay the week’s bills. If only
Aunt Anne could be made to understand
the value of money, Florence thought—but
it was no use thinking, for her foolish, housekeeping
heart was full of domestic woe. She
went upstairs to her own room, and, like a
real woman who makes no pretence to strong-mindedness,
sat down to cry.</p>

<p>“If Walter were only back,” she sobbed,
as she rubbed her tearful face against the
cushions on the back of the basket-chair by
the fireside. “If he were here I should not
mind, I might even laugh then. But after I
have tried and tried so hard to save and to
spend so little, it is hard, and I don’t know
what to do.” She pulled out Walter’s letter
and read it again by way of getting a little
comfort, and as she did so, felt the envelope
containing the receipts of the bills Mrs.
North had paid. She did not believe that
Aunt Anne cared whether they were paid
or not paid. She always seemed to think
that the classes, who were what she pleased
to consider beneath her, were invented
simply for her use and convenience, and
that protest in any shape on their part was
mere impertinence.</p>

<p>The day dragged by. The children prevented
the early dinner from being as awkward
as it might have been. Mrs. Baines
was cold and courteous. Florence had no
words to say. She would make it up with
the old lady in the evening, when they
were alone, she thought. Of course she
would have to make it up. Meanwhile,
she would go for a long walk, it would
do her good. She could think things over
quietly, as she tramped along a lonely road
between the hedges of faded gorse and
heather. But it was late in the afternoon
before she had energy enough to start. On
her way out, she put her head in at the
dining-room door. Mrs. Baines was there
with the morning paper, which had just
come. She was evidently excited and agitated,
and held the paper in one hand
while she looked out towards the garden.
But she seemed to have forgotten all the
unpleasantness of the morning when she
spoke.</p>

<p>“My love, are you going out?” she
asked.</p>

<p>“I thought you had an engagement, Aunt
Anne, and would not want me.”</p>

<p>“That is true, my dear, and I shall be
glad to be alone for a little while, if you will
forgive me for saying it. There is an announcement
in the paper that gives me the
deepest pain, Florence. Sir William Rammage
is ill again—he is confined to his
room.”</p>

<p>“Oh, poor Aunt Anne!”</p>

<p>“I must write to him instantly. I felt
sure there was some good reason for his not
having told me his decision in regard to the
allowance.” Then, as if she had suddenly
remembered the little scrimmage of the
morning, she went on quickly, “My love,
give me a kiss. Do not think that I am
angry with you. I never could be that; but
it is unpleasant at my time of life to be made
to give an exact account of money. You
will remember that, won’t you, dear? I
should never expect it from you. If I had
hundreds and hundreds a year I would share
them with you and your darlings, and I
would ask you for no accounts, dear Florence.
I should think that the money was as much
yours as mine. You know it, don’t you, my
love?”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear, I think I do,” Florence
answered, and kissed the old lady affectionately,
thinking that perhaps, after all,
she had made rather too much fuss.</p>

<p>“Then let us forget about it, my darling,”
Mrs. Baines said, with the gracious smile
that always had its influence; “I could never
remember anything long of you, but your
kindness and hospitality. Believe me, I am
quite sure that you did not mean to wound
me this morning. It was your zealous care
of dear Walter’s interests that caused you for
a moment to forget what was due to me. I
quite understand, my darling. Now go for
your walk, and be assured that Aunt Anne
loves you.”</p>

<p>And Florence was dismissed, feeling as
the children had felt the evening before
when they had been sent to bed and told
of the chocolate under their pillows.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XI.</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><img class='dropcap' src='images/capt.jpg' style='float:left;width:5%;' alt='T'/>he</span> grey sky and the dim trees, the
black hedges and the absolute stillness;
all these proved excellent comforters
to Florence. They made her philosophical
and almost smiling again. It was only when
an empty waggonette of Steggall’s passed
her that she remembered the vexations of
the morning. “Poor old lady,” she said to
herself with almost a laugh, “in future she
must not be trusted with money, that is all.
If she only would not scold me and treat me
like a child, I should not mind it so much.
Of course when Walter does it, I like it;
but I don’t like it from Aunt Anne.”</p>

<p>She had walked a long way. She was
getting tired. The messengers of night
were abroad, the stray breezes, the dark
flecked clouds, the shadows loitering by the
trees, the strange little sounds among the
hedges by the wayside. Far off, beyond
the wood, she heard a clock belonging to
a big house strike six. It was time to hurry
home. If she walked the two miles between
herself and the cottage quickly, she would be
in by half-past six. At seven, after the children
had gone to bed, she and Aunt Anne
were to sit down to a little evening meal
they called supper. They would be very
cosy that night; they would linger over their
food, and Aunt Anne should talk of bygone
days, and the quaint old world that always
seemed to be just behind her.</p>

<p>It was rather dull in the country, Florence
thought. In the summer, of course, the outdoor
life made it delightful, but now there
was so little to fill the days, only the children
and the housekeeping, wonderings about
Walter, and the writing of the bit of diary
on very thin paper which she had promised
to post out to him every week. She was
not a woman who made an intellectual atmosphere
for herself. She lived her life through
her husband, read the same books, and drew
her conclusions by the light of his. Now
that he had gone the world seemed half
empty, and very dull and tame. There was
no glamour over anything. Perhaps it was
this that had helped to make her a little
unkind to Aunt Anne, for gradually she was
persuading herself that she had been unkind.
She wished Aunt Anne had an income of
her own, and the home for which she had
said she longed. It would be so much
better for everybody.</p>

<p>When she was nearly home, a sudden
dread seized her lest Mr. Wimple should
be there, but this, she reflected, was not
likely. It was long past calling-time, and
Aunt Anne was too great a stickler for
etiquette to allow him to take a liberty, as
she would call it. So Florence quickened
her steps, and entered her home bravely to
the sound of the children’s voices upstairs
singing as they went to bed. A fire was
blazing in the dining-room, and everything
looked comfortable, just as it had the night
before. But there was no sign of Aunt
Anne. Probably she was upstairs “getting
ready,” for a lace cap and bit of white at her
throat and an extra formal, though not less
affectionate, manner than usual Aunt Anne
seemed to think a fitting accompaniment to
the evening meal. Florence looked round
the dining-room with a little pride of ownership.
She was fond of the cottage, it was
their very own, hers and Walter’s; and how
wise they had been to do up that particular
room, it made every meal they ate in it a
pleasure. That buttery-hatch too, it was
absurd that it should be so, but really it was
a secret joy to her. Suddenly her eye caught
a package that had evidently come in her
absence. A parcel of any sort was always
exciting. This could not be another present
from Aunt Anne? and she drew a short
breath. Oh no, it had come by rail. Books.
She knew what it was—some novels from
Mr. Fisher. “How kind he is,” she said
gratefully; “he says so few words, but he
does so many things. I really don’t see why
Ethel should not love him. I don’t think
she would find it difficult to do so,” she
thought, with the forgetfulness of womanhood
for the days of girlish fancy.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Baines has not yet returned,” the
servant said, entering to arrange the table.</p>

<p>“Not returned. Is she out, then?”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am, she started half an hour
after you did. Steggall’s waggonette came
for her.”</p>

<p>Florence groaned inwardly.</p>

<p>“Do you know where she has gone?”</p>

<p>“I think she has gone to Guildford, ma’am,
shopping; she often did while you were
away. I heard her tell the driver to drive
quickly to the station, as she feared she was
late.”</p>

<p>“Oh. Did any one call, Jane?”</p>

<p>“No, ma’am.”</p>

<p>Then, once more, Florence delivered herself
over to despair. Aunt Anne must have
gone to buy more surprises, and if she had
only ten shillings in the world it was quite
clear she would have to get them on credit.
Something would have to be done. The
tradespeople would have to be warned.
Walter must be written to, and, if necessary,
asked to cable over advice. Perhaps Sir
William Rammage would interfere. In the
midst of all her perturbation seven o’clock
struck, and there was no Aunt Anne.</p>

<p>Florence was a healthy young woman, and
she had had a long walk. The pangs of
hunger assailed her vigorously, so, after resisting
them till half-past seven, she sat down
to her little supper alone. Food has a soothing
effect on an agitated mind, and a quarter
of an hour later, though Aunt Anne had not
appeared, Florence had come to the conclusion
that she could not get very deeply
into debt, because it was not likely that the
tradespeople would trust her. Perhaps, too,
after all, she had not gone to Guildford. Still,
what could keep her out so late? The roads
were dark and lonely, she knew no one in
the neighbourhood. It was to be hoped that
nothing had happened to her, and, at this
thought, Florence began to reproach herself
again for all her unkindness of the morning.
But while she was still reviewing her own
conduct with much severity there was a soft
patter, patter, along the gravel path outside,
and a feeble ring at the bell. “That dissipated
old lady!” laughed Florence to herself,
only too delighted to think that she had
returned safely at last.</p>

<p>A moment later Aunt Anne entered. She
was a little breathless, her left eye winked
more frequently than usual, there was an air
of happy excitement in her manner. She
entered the room quickly, and seated herself
in the easy-chair with a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>“My darling,” she said, looking fondly at
Florence, “I trust you did not wait for me,
and that I have not caused you any inconvenience.
But if I have,” she added in an
almost cooing voice, “you will forgive me
when you know all.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, dear Aunt Anne, I will forgive
you,” and Florence signed to Jane to bring
a plate. “You must be shockingly hungry,”
she laughed. “Where have you been, may
I know?”</p>

<p>“I will tell you presently, my darling; you
shall know all. But I cannot eat anything,”
Aunt Anne answered quickly. Even the
thought of food seemed to make her impatient.
“Jane,” she said, with the little air of pride
that Jane resented, “you need not bring
a plate for me. I do not require anything.”
Then, speaking to Florence again, she went
on with half-beaming, half-condescending
gentleness, “Finish your repast, my darling;
pray don’t let my intrusion—for it is an
intrusion when I am not able to join in your
meal—hurry you. When you have finished,
but not till then, I have a communication to
make to you. It is one I feel to be due to
you before any one else; and it will prove
to you how much I depend on your sympathy
and love.” She spoke with earnestness, unfastening
her cloak and nervously fastening
it the while. Florence looked at her with
a little pity. Poor old lady, she thought,
how easily she worked herself into a state
of excitement.</p>

<p>“Tell me what it is now, dear Aunt
Anne,” she said. “Has anything occurred
to worry you? Where have you been—to
Guildford?”</p>

<p>“To Guildford? No, my dear. Something
has occurred, but not to worry me. It
is something that will make me very happy,
and I trust that it will make you very happy
to hear it. I rely on your sympathy and
Walter’s to support me.” Florence was not
very curious. Aunt Anne had always so
much earnestness at her command, and was
very prodigal of it. Besides, it did not
seem likely that anything important had
happened; some trifling pleasure or vexation,
probably; nothing more.</p>

<p>At last the little meal was finished, the
things pushed through the buttery-hatch, the
crumbs swept off the cloth by Jane, who
seemed to linger in a manner that Mrs.
Baines in her own mind felt to be wholly
reprehensible and wanting in respect towards
her superiors. But the cloth was folded and
put away at last, the buttery-hatch closed,
the fire adjusted, and the door shut. Aunt
Anne gave a sigh of relief, then throwing
her cloak back over the chair, she rose
and stood irresolute on the hearth-rug.
Florence went towards her.</p>

<p>“Have you been anywhere by train?”
she asked.</p>

<p>“No, my love. I went to the station to
meet some one.” She trembled with excitement
while she spoke. Florence noticed
it with wonder.</p>

<p>“What is it, Aunt Anne?” she asked
gently.</p>

<p>The old lady stretched out her two thin
hands, and suddenly dropped her head for
a moment on Florence’s shoulder; but she
raised it quickly, and evidently struggled to
be calm.</p>

<p>“My darling,” she said, “I know you will
sympathize with me, I know your loving
heart. I knew it the first day I saw
you, when you were at Rottingdean, and
stood under the pear-tree with your dear
Walter——”</p>

<p>“Yes, oh yes, dear——” Florence had
so often heard of that pear-tree. But what
could it have to do with the present
situation?</p>

<p>—“I shall never forget the picture you
two made,” the old lady went on, not heeding
the interruption; “I knew all that was
in your dear heart then, just as I feel that
you will understand all that is in mine now.”
Her face was flushed, her eyes were almost
bright, and there were tears in them; the left
one winked tremulously.</p>

<p>Florence looked at her in amazement.
“What is it, Aunt Anne? Do tell me;
tell me at once, dear?” she said entreatingly.
“And where you have been, so late and in
the dark.” For a moment Aunt Anne
hesitated, then, with a gasp and a strong
effort to be calm and dignified, she raised
her head and spoke.</p>

<p>“My dear—my dear, all this time I have
been with Alfred Wimple. He loves me.”</p>

<p>“He loves you,” Florence repeated, her
eyes full of wonder; “he loves you. Yes,
of course he loves you, we all do,” she said
soothingly, too much surprised to speculate
farther.</p>

<p>“Yes, he loves me,” Aunt Anne said
again, in an almost solemn voice, “and I
have promised to be his wife.”</p>

<p>“Aunt Anne!—to marry him!”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear, to marry him,” and she waited
as if for congratulations.</p>

<p>“But, Aunt Anne, dear——” Florence
began in astonishment, and then she stopped;
for though she had had some idea of the old
lady’s infatuation, she had never dreamt of
its ending in matrimony. Mrs. Baines was
excited and strange; it might be some
delusion, some joke that had been played
on her, for Mr. Wimple could not have
seriously asked her to marry him. She
waited, not knowing what to say. But
Aunt Anne’s excitement seemed to be
passing, and with a tender, pitiful expression
on her face, she waited for her niece
to speak. “But, Aunt Anne, dear,” was
all Florence could say again in her bewilderment.</p>

<p>“But what, Florence?” Mrs. Baines
spoke with a surprised, half-resentful manner.
“Have you nothing more to say to me,
my love?”</p>

<p>“But you are not really going to marry
him, are you?” Florence asked, in an incredulous
voice.</p>

<p>The old lady answered in a terribly earnest
one.</p>

<p>“Yes, Florence, I am; and never shall
man have truer, more loving help-meet than
I will be to him,” she burst out heroically,
holding herself erect and looking her niece
in the face. There was something infinitely
pathetic about her as she stood there, quivering
with feeling and aching for sympathy,
yet old, wrinkled, and absurd, her poor
scanty hair pushed back and her weak eyes
full of tears. For a moment there was
silence. Then bewildered Florence broke
out with—</p>

<p>“But, Aunt Anne, but, Aunt Anne——”</p>

<p>“Well, my love?” the old lady asked
with calm dignity.</p>

<p>“He—he is much younger than you,”
she said at last, bringing out her words
slowly, and hating herself for saying them.</p>

<p>“Age is not counted by years, my darling;
and if he does not feel my age a drawback,
why should I count his youth one? He
loves me, Florence, I know he loves me,”
Aunt Anne broke out in a passionate,
tearful voice, “and you would not have me
throw away or depreciate a faithful heart
that has been given me?”</p>

<p>Then the practical side of Florence’s
nature spoke up in despair. “But, Aunt
Anne, he—is very poor.”</p>

<p>“I know he is poor, but he is young and
strong and hopeful; and he will work. He
says he will work like a slave for me; and if
he is content to face poverty with me, how
can I be afraid to face it with him?”</p>

<p>“But you want comforts, and——”</p>

<p>“Oh no, my love. My tastes are very
simple, and I shall be content to do without
them for his sake.”</p>

<p>“But at your time of life, dear Aunt Anne,
you do want them—you are not young—as
he is.” Then Mrs. Baines burst into tears,
tears that were evidently a blessed relief,
and had been pent up in her poor old heart,
waiting for an excuse to come forth.</p>

<p>“Florence, I did not think you would tell
me of my age. If I do not feel it, and he
does not, why should you remind me of it?
And why should you tell me that he is poor?
Do you suppose that I am so selfish or—or
so depraved that I would sell myself for
comfort and luxury? If he can face poverty
with me, I can face it with him.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, but——” The old lady did
not heed her, and went on breathlessly—</p>

<p>“I did think, Florence, that you would
have been kind to me, and understood and
sympathized. I told him that on your heart
and Walter’s I could rely. You know how
lonely I have been, how desolate and how
miserable. But for your bounty and goodness
I should have died——”</p>

<p>“Oh no——”</p>

<p>“And now, in this great crisis—now, when
a young, brave, beautiful life is laid at my
feet, now that I am loved as truly as ever
woman was loved in this world, as tenderly
as Walter loves you, Florence, you fail me,
as—as if”—she put her hand to her throat
to steady her quivering voice—“as if you
would not let me taste the cup of happiness
of which you drink every day.”</p>

<p>“But, Aunt Anne, it isn’t that indeed,”
Florence answered, thinking despairingly of
Walter, and wishing that she could begin
writing that very minute, asking him what
on earth she ought to say or do. “It is
that—that—it is so unexpected, so strange.
I knew, of course, that you liked him, that
you were good friends; but I never dreamt
that he was in love with you.” Aunt Anne’s
tears seemed to vanish as if by magic, her
left eye winked almost fiercely, her lips
opened, but no sound came. With a great
effort she recovered her voice at last, and
with some of her old dignity, dashed with
severe surprise, she asked—</p>

<p>“My darling, is there any reason why he
should not love me?”</p>

<p>She stood gravely waiting for a reply,
while Florence felt that she was managing
badly, that she was somehow hurting and
insulting Aunt Anne. After all, the old lady
had a right to do as she liked; it was
evident that she was incapable of taking in
the absurdity of the situation.</p>

<p>“But, Aunt Anne——” she began and
stopped.</p>

<p>“My dear Florence,” Mrs. Baines repeated
still more severely, “will you tell me if there
is any very obvious reason why he should
not love me? I am not an ogress, my
darling—I am not an ogress,” she cried,
suddenly breaking down and bursting into
floods of tears, while her head dropped on
to her black merino dress.</p>

<p>She looked so old and worn, so wretched
and lonely as she stood there weeping
bitterly, that Florence could stand it no
longer, and going forward she put her arms
round the poor old soul, and kissed her
fondly.</p>

<p>“No, dear Aunt Anne,” she said, “you
are not an ogress; you are a sweet old dear,
and I love you. Don’t cry—don’t cry, you
dear.”</p>

<p>“My love, you are cruel to me,” Aunt
Anne sobbed.</p>

<p>“Oh no, I am not, and you shall marry
any one you like. It was a little surprising,
you know, and of course I didn’t—I didn’t
think that marrying was in your thoughts,”
she added feebly, for she didn’t know what
to say.</p>

<p>“Bless you, my darling, bless you,” the
old lady gasped, grateful for even that straw
of comfort; “I knew you would be staunch
to me when you had recovered from the
surprise of my communication, but——” and
she gently disengaged herself from Florence’s
embrace and spoke in the nervous quivering
voice that always came to her in moments
of excitement—“but, Florence, since the
first moment we met, Alfred Wimple and I
have felt that we were ordained for each
other.”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear,” Florence said soothingly.</p>

<p>“He says he shall never forget the
moments we sat together on your balcony
that night when your dear Walter fetched
the white shawl—of yours, Florence—to put
round my shoulders,” the old lady went on
earnestly. “And the sympathy between us
is so great that we do not feel the difference
of years; besides, he says he has never liked
very young women, he has always felt that
the power to love accumulated with time, as
my power to love has done. Few of the
women who have been loved by great men
have been very young, my darling.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know,” Florence began, for
Aunt Anne had paused, almost as if she
were repeating something she had learned
by heart.</p>

<p>“He asked me to-night,” she went on
with another little gasp, “if I remembered—if
I remembered—I forget——but all the
great passions of history have been concentrated
on women in their prime. Petrarch’s
Laura had eight children when the poet fell
in love with her, and Helen of Troy was
sixty when—when—I forget,” she said again,
shaking her head; “but he remembers; he
went through them all to-night. Besides,
I may be old in years, but I am not old at
heart; you cannot say that I am, Florence.”</p>

<p>She was getting excited again. Almost
without her knowledge Florence led her to
the easy-chair, and gently pushing her on to
it, undid the strings and tried to take off her
bonnet; but the old lady resisted.</p>

<p>“No, my dear, don’t take off my bonnet,”
she said, “unless you will permit me to ring,”
she added, getting back to her old-fashioned
ways, “and request Jane to bring me my
cap from upstairs.”</p>

<p>But Florence felt that Jane might look
curiously at the wrinkled face that still
showed signs of recent agitation, so she put
her hand softly on the one that Aunt Anne
had stretched out to touch the bell.</p>

<p>“I will get it for you, dear,” she said, and
in a moment she had flown upstairs and
brought down the soft lace cap put ready
on the bed, and the cashmere slippers edged
with fur and lined with red flannel, in which
Aunt Anne liked to encase her feet in the
evening. “There, now, you will feel better,
you poor dear,” she said when they were put
on and the old lady sat silent and composed,
looking as if she were contemplating her
future, and the new life before her. Florence
stood by her silently for a moment, thinking
over the past weeks in which Aunt Anne,
with her poverty and dignity, her generosity
and recklessness, had formed so striking a
figure. Then she thought of the lonely life
the poor old lady had led in the Kilburn
lodging.</p>

<p>After all, if she only had even a very little
happiness with that horrid Mr. Wimple, it
would be something; and of course, if he
didn’t behave properly, Walter could take
her away. The worst of it was she had
understood that Mr. Wimple had no money.
She had heard that he lived on a small
allowance from an uncle, and the uncle
might stop that allowance when he heard
that his nephew had married an old woman
who had not a penny.</p>

<p>“Aunt Anne,” she asked gently, “does he
know that you are not rich?”</p>

<p>“Florence, I told him plainly that I had
no fortune,” the old lady answered, with a
pathetic half-hunted look on her face that
made Florence hate herself for her lack
of sympathy. But she felt that she ought
to ask some questions. Walter would be so
angry if she allowed her to go into misery
and fresh poverty without making a single
effort to save her.</p>

<p>“And has he money, dear—enough to
keep you both, at any rate?”</p>

<p>The tears trickled down Aunt Anne’s face
again while she answered—</p>

<p>“If I did not ask him that question,
Florence, it is not for you to ask it me. I
neither know nor care what he has. If he
is willing to take me for myself only, so am
I willing to take him, loving him for himself
only too. I am too old to marry for money,
and he is too noble to do so. We are grown-up
man and woman, Florence, and know
our own hearts; we will brook no interference,
my darling, not even from you.”
She got up tremblingly. “I must retire;
you must allow me to retire, and in the
privacy of my own room I shall be able to
reflect.”</p>

<p>The long words were coming back; they
were a sign that Aunt Anne was herself
again.</p>

<p>“Yes, dear Aunt Anne; I am sure you
must want to be alone, and to think,”
Florence said gently.</p>

<p>The old lady was not appeased.</p>

<p>“You know—you remember what you felt
yourself when your Walter first loved you,
Florence,” she said distantly. “Yes, I must
be alone; my heart is full—I must be
alone.”</p>

<p>Florence led her upstairs to her room.
Mrs. Baines stood formally in the doorway.</p>

<p>“Good-night, my love,” she said, with cold
disappointment in her voice.</p>

<p>“May not I help you, Aunt Anne?”
Florence asked, almost entreatingly.</p>

<p>“No, my love, I must be alone,” Mrs.
Baines repeated firmly, and shut the door.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XII.</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><img class='dropcap' src='images/capt.jpg' style='float:left;width:5%;' alt='T'/>he</span> next morning Aunt Anne did not
appear. She sent word that she
would like her breakfast carried up, a fire
lighted in her room, and to be left alone for
a couple of hours.</p>

<p>Florence was distracted. She had written
to Walter, but as the mail did not go out till
three days later, nothing was gained by her
haste. She had considered things all round,
and the more she did so the more amazing
did Mr. Wimple’s proposal seem. It was
all nonsense to suppose, as Aunt Anne
evidently believed, that he was in love with
a woman more than twice his age. Florence
mentally reviewed Aunt Anne’s charms.
She was not even a round, plump old lady
with rosy cheeks, and a stray dimple that
seemed to have found her company so good
it was loath to vanish altogether. She was
wrinkled, and thin, and feeble-looking. Her
eyes were small and weak, the left one had
the nervous affection that so often provided
an almost droll accompaniment to her talk.
Her skin was withered and sallow. Florence
tried to feel like a young man about to marry
Aunt Anne, and the idea was not pleasant.
She felt that it was almost a duty to prevent
the marriage if possible—that Aunt Anne
owed it to her past years, to her own dignity,
to her relations, to every one and everything
not to make a fool of herself.</p>

<p>The children went out at ten o’clock.
Florence listened to their shouts of joy as
they drove off in the donkey-cart. Then,
hurrying through her domestic affairs, she
sat down on one of the gaunt easy-chairs by
the drawing-room fire to think matters over
again. It somehow seemed fitting to sit in
the old-world little room while she considered
Aunt Anne’s romance. She could hear the
old lady moving about overhead, but was
afraid to go up, for she had been refused
admittance two hours ago. Jane, who was
overwhelmed with curiosity, had managed to
go in and out once or twice, and reported
that Mrs. Baines was dressed and looking
through the contents of her trunks “just as
if she was packing up.” Florence wondered
what it meant, and a dim suspicion of the
truth crossed her mind. She felt too as if
in the little cottage by the lonely roadside
a tragedy was beginning in which Aunt Anne
would play the central figure. She shut
her eyes for a moment, and, as if in a dream,
could see the old lady wringing her thin
hands, and stretching them out almost imploringly.
“Oh, dear Aunt Anne,” she
cried, “something must be done. No good
can come of this wild nonsense.”</p>

<p>Suddenly on the gravel footpath outside
she heard a footstep, just as she had heard
Aunt Anne’s footstep the night before. She
got up quickly and looked out. It was Mr.
Wimple. He must have come up from the
dip at the end of the garden, the short way
from Hindhead and the Liphook Road. He
was going round the house. Florence darted
out and opened the front door before he had
time to ring. All in a moment it had struck
her that if she could get a talk with him,
some explanation, perhaps some good, might
come of it. Yet her heart ached, she felt
cruel and treacherous, as if she were trying
to cheat Aunt Anne of a promise—even
though it was a ridiculous promise—of
happiness. She thought of the poor old
lady’s tears, of her pleading, of her piteous,
“as if you grudged me the cup of happiness
of which you taste every day.” After all,
she had a right to do as she pleased; but
that was a foolish argument. She had a
right to put herself on the kitchen fire if she
pleased, but it would be distinctly the duty
of the nearest person to pull her off and
prevent her from being burnt.</p>

<p>Mr. Wimple stared at Florence. “How do
you do, Mrs. Hibbert?” he said with extreme
gravity. He did not hold out his hand or
look as if he expected to enter, but stood
still on the door-step.</p>

<p>“I saw you coming and wanted to speak
to you, Mr. Wimple,” she said almost breathlessly.
“Won’t you come in?” Without
a word he entered. She led the way to
the drawing-room and shut the door. She
pointed to one of the chairs beside the screen
with a peacock on it, and he sat down, still
without a word, and waited for her to speak.
She took the other chair and faced him.
The light was full upon him, but there was
no expression in his eyes, not even one of
inquiry.</p>

<p>“Mr. Wimple,” she said, in a low voice,
for she was afraid of Aunt Anne above
hearing the hum of conversation, “I wanted
to speak to you about Aunt Anne—Mrs.
Baines.” He looked at her then, but still
he said nothing. “I am very fond of her,”
she added, as if in excuse for her interference.</p>

<p>“I am sure you are,” he answered, and
waited. Florence was forced to go on.</p>

<p>“She came home last night, and she
surprised me so—she told me—oh, Mr.
Wimple, it can’t be true?”</p>

<p>“What cannot be true, Mrs. Hibbert?”
he asked, speaking like an automaton.</p>

<p>“That—that—you had asked her to marry
you?”</p>

<p>“It is quite true,” he said, and looked at
her unflinchingly; his face wore an expression
of slight surprise.</p>

<p>“But it is so strange and unsuitable; she
is so much older than you.”</p>

<p>“I know she is much older.” He seemed
to unlock his lips every time he spoke.</p>

<p>“She is quite old and feeble,” Florence
said compassionately.</p>

<p>“Yes, she is quite old and feeble,” he
repeated.</p>

<p>“And, Mr. Wimple, do you know that she
is not rich, that—that she has no money,
nothing. She is poor.”</p>

<p>“I know she is poor, Mrs. Hibbert.” He
seemed to be afflicted with an utter destitution
of language, an incapacity to say anything
but the shortest, most cut-and-dried sentence.
It affected Florence. But again she struggled
on; though she felt her words come with
difficulty.</p>

<p>“And you—forgive me, but I am fond of
her—and you, I believe, are not rich. Walter
told me that you were not, and—and——”
She was beginning to despair of making any
way with Mr. Wimple, his eyes were dull
and uninterested, he seemed insensible to
everything except the burden of his own
gravity.</p>

<p>“I am not rich, Mrs. Hibbert,” he said.
The manner in which he repeated her name
at the end of every sentence irritated
Florence.</p>

<p>“And oh, Mr. Wimple,” she went on, “it
is so—so absurd.” But he said nothing, though
she waited. “It is so strange, and Walter
will be very angry.”</p>

<p>“It is not Walters affair, Mrs. Hibbert, it
is mine,” he said.</p>

<p>“And hers, and Aunt Anne’s too.”</p>

<p>“And hers,” he repeated.</p>

<p>“And she is old, she wants comforts and
luxury; and oh, I cannot bear to think of it.
It seems cruel.”</p>

<p>“We have talked it all over, Mrs. Hibbert;
she knows best herself what she wants,” he
answered, without the slightest change in his
manner.</p>

<p>“But are you really in love with her?”</p>

<p>“I am very fond of her,” he said blankly.</p>

<p>Florence put her hand to her throat to
steady her utterance.</p>

<p>“But you are not in love with her? You
can’t be; she is old enough to be your
mother. She is a dear, sweet old lady, but
you can’t be in love with her.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see the necessity of our discussing
this,” he said, still with extreme gravity.</p>

<p>“But she is my aunt, at least she is
Walter’s, which is all the same.” He gave
a little dry cough.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Baines and I have settled our
affairs, Mrs. Hibbert,” he said. “There is
no necessity to go over them.”</p>

<p>“But it is so ridiculous.”</p>

<p>“Then we will not talk about it.” Suddenly
he looked at her; there was no change
in his tone, but he opened his eyes a little
wider as if to impress upon her the importance
of his next words. “We don’t wish
our private affairs made known to the world,”
he said. “There is no necessity to talk of
them at all; they are of no importance except
to ourselves. We don’t wish to talk about
them or to hear of their being talked about.
Will you remember this, Mrs. Hibbert?”
It was quite a relief to get three consecutive
sentences out of him.</p>

<p>“But, Mr. Wimple, do tell me that, if you
persist in marrying her, you will make her
happy, you will be good to her, and—that
you can keep her in some sort of comfort,”
Florence said in despair.</p>

<p>“I will talk to her about this, Mrs. Hibbert.
It is her affair,” he said solemnly; and
Florence felt altogether worsted, left out in
the cold, put back, and powerless. She sat
silently by the fire, not knowing what to do
or say. Mr. Wimple made no sign. She
looked up at him after a minute or two.
What could Aunt Anne see to like in him,
in his dull eyes, his thin lips, his straggling
sandy hair and whiskers, his pink-and-white,
yet unhealthy-looking complexion? He met
her gaze steadily. “Is there anything more
you wish to say to me?” he asked; “I have
not much time.”</p>

<p>“No,” she answered, chokingly, “there is
nothing—if you would only be a son to her,
a friend, anything, rather than marry her.
Oh, Mr. Wimple, if you really do care for
her, don’t make her ridiculous in her old age,
don’t make her unhappy. Happiness cannot
come of an absurd marriage like this. You
ought to marry a girl, a young woman.
One day Walter and I saw you at Waterloo——”</p>

<p>He fixed his eyes upon her, and there was
a slight look of curiosity in them now, but he
was absolutely calm.</p>

<p>“Well, Mrs. Hibbert?” he said.</p>

<p>“We thought that perhaps she was—was
some one you liked; she was young, it would
have been much more suitable.”</p>

<p>“I must know what I desire, and what
is most suitable for myself, Mrs. Hibbert,”
he answered, without a shade of vexation,
but with quiet determination in his voice.
Then Jane, evidently to her own satisfaction,
entered.</p>

<p>“If you please, ma’am, Mrs. Baines says
she would like to speak to Mr. Wimple when
you have quite finished with him.”</p>

<p>“Tell Mrs. Baines I will go up to her in a
moment; I want to see her.” She turned
to Mr. Wimple again when Jane had gone.
He rose as if to signify that he considered
their conversation at an end. “I fear there
is nothing more to say,” she said lamely, for
this man, with his silence and utter lack of
response, had made every word that suggested
itself seem weak and hopeless.</p>

<p>“I think not, Mrs. Hibbert.”</p>

<p>“But for your own happiness, Mr.
Wimple,” she said suddenly, struck with a
new way of putting it, “you surely can’t
want to marry Mrs. Baines for the sake of
your own happiness.”</p>

<p>“I want to marry Mrs. Baines as much for
my own sake as for hers,” and he looked at
her in a manner that was almost a dismissal.
It had an influence over her she could not
help; almost against her will she rose, feeling
that there was no excuse for prolonging the
interview.</p>

<p>“I will send Mrs. Baines to you,” she said,
in despair.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mrs. Hibbert, if you will,”
and he held open the door for her to pass
out.</p>

<p>Aunt Anne heard the drawing-room door
open and Florence coming up. She waited
eagerly on the top of the stairs. She wore
her best dress; round her throat there was
a white silk handkerchief, in her manner
more than the usual nervous agitation.
Glancing in at the bedroom Florence could
see that she had been packing, and making
ready for a journey.</p>

<p>“Oh, Aunt Anne——” she began.</p>

<p>“Yes, my love, I am going to town,” the
old lady said, with a cold reserve in her
tenderness that showed clearly she was displeased.
“I cannot stay longer under your
roof. You must not ask me to do so,” she
went on. “I was cut to the quick by your
want of sympathy last night. I cannot
recover from it; I could not expose myself
to it again. My luggage is ready, and when
I have seen my dear Alfred I shall be able
to tell you the time of my departure.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Aunt Anne, it is cruel,” Florence said,
dismayed.</p>

<p>“No, my love, it is not cruel; but I must
respect myself. I would not hurt you for
the world, Florence; but you have hurt me.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t hurt you either for the world,
but——”</p>

<p>“Where is Mr. Wimple, my love?” the old
lady asked, interrupting her niece with a
long sigh.</p>

<p>“He is downstairs; I have been talking to
him.”</p>

<p>“Yes, my love, I understand. I appreciate
all your solicitude for my happiness;
but you should allow those who are older
and wiser than you to know what is best for
themselves. I will see you again when he
is gone, Florence,” and almost imperiously
Mrs. Baines went downstairs.</p>

<p>She entered the drawing-room and shut
the door. Mr. Wimple was standing on the
hearth-rug. She looked at him for a moment
nervously, and winked solemnly as usual
with her left eye.</p>

<p>“My darling,” she said, and putting her
arms round his neck she kissed his face on
both sides, “my darling Alfred, are you glad
to see me?” He submitted to her caress
half reluctantly, then drew back a little.
His manner was no warmer than it had been
to Florence.</p>

<p>“Yes, I am glad to see you,” he said, and
looked at her with his eyes wide open, as if
to show that he perfectly understood the
position.</p>

<p>“My darling, I have suffered terribly.
Florence had no sympathy for us; she said
it was an unsuitable marriage; that you had
no fortune, and that I had none; as if my
poverty was not hard enough to bear without
being told of it. What did she say to you?
Alfred, my dear one, she has not turned
your love from me?” She put out her arms
again as if to gather him to her, but he
looked blindly past her.</p>

<p>“Sit down,” he said, and pushed her
gently on to the chair beside the peacock-screen.</p>

<p>“She has not taken your love from me,
tell me that,” Mrs. Baines said entreatingly.
“A few hours ago you assured me of your
devotion. She has not taken it from me?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“I am just the same to you?” she asked.
He turned his eyes on her again.</p>

<p>“You are just the same,” he said, with a
gulp, but there was no tenderness in his
manner. He seemed to be speaking almost
under compulsion.</p>

<p>“My darling, my darling,” she said softly,
“bless you for those dear words. I will be
truer to you, Alfred, than ever woman was
to man before. But I cannot stay here;
you must take me away. I have already
packed my things, I cannot remain another
night, not knowing to what treatment I may
be subjected. I love Florence most sincerely;
she and Walter and their children are very
dear to me. But after her coldness to me
last night when I came in full of your love
and my own happiness, and she denied me
her sympathy, I cannot stay. You must not
ask me to do that, Alfred.” There was
more interest in his manner now, though his
gravity never relaxed.</p>

<p>“Where will you go?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I shall go to London, my darling,” she
said, stretching out her hands. “But I
cannot go alone, after all I have suffered
during the last twenty-four hours?” He
looked at her questioningly.</p>

<p>“Suffered? What have you suffered?” he
asked. “I thought you were happy about it.”</p>

<p>“About you? Yes, my darling; but
Florence has tortured me.”</p>

<p>“It does not take much to torture you,”
he interrupted. “What did she say?”</p>

<p>“I have told you already; I cannot go
over it again. Don’t ask me to do so. You
could torture me, Alfred, with a word or a
look—if you ceased to love me.”</p>

<p>“We need not discuss that improbability
now,” he said solemnly. “What about your
going to London?”</p>

<p>“I shall go by the quarter-past one o’clock
train this afternoon,” she answered. “You
will take me, will you not?”</p>

<p>“I cannot go to-day,” he said firmly. “I
must get back to Liphook now.” He
pulled out his watch, a dull worn Waterbury
one, at which Aunt Anne looked keenly.
“But I will go to-morrow; I want to see
my uncle.” His thoughts seemed to be
intent on business matters. She waited a
moment after he had finished speaking, and
winked slowly to herself before she answered.</p>

<p>“Alfred,” she asked, “you do truly love
me?” He looked at her steadfastly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he answered, “I told you so last
night.” She half rose from her chair again,
but he waved her back. “Sit down,” he
said, and she obeyed.</p>

<p>“I know you did, and I will never doubt
it. In bygone days, my darling, I was foolish
and wicked, and played with the truest love
ever given to woman. But I am wiser now.
You must never doubt me. Promise me
that you never will.”</p>

<p>“I promise you,” he said, and closed his
lips.</p>

<p>“My dear, my dear,” she said softly to
herself, and stopped for a moment before
she went on aloud, “I must go to town
this afternoon, and you must take me. My
courage is not equal to encountering the
journey alone. Do take me, my darling.”</p>

<p>“Where will you go when you get to
London?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I know of some apartments—two rooms—I
saw them the day before I came away.
If they are still unlet, I shall rent them.
But when we arrive I shall go straight to Sir
William Rammage. I have business with
him. He is very ill, Alfred, it was in the
paper yesterday; but he will see me, and
when he knows all——”</p>

<p>“You will tell him nothing about me,”
he said, in his slow determined voice. She
looked up indignantly.</p>

<p>“Alfred,” she answered, “I must tell him.
I shall tell him that you love me; that I
have won a true and noble heart, and that
we are going through life together.”</p>

<p>“You will tell him nothing,” Mr. Wimple
repeated, with something like fright in his
dull eyes. “If you did my uncle would hear
of it, and would think I was mad.” He
added the clause about his uncle as if he
thought an explanation due to her.</p>

<p>“Mad to marry me?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Mad to think of marriage at all. He
objects to it on principle.”</p>

<p>“But if he knew how tenderly and truly
I loved you——”</p>

<p>“You must not say one word about it, to
him or to any one,” came the firm hard
voice.</p>

<p>“Is it because you are—you are ashamed
of loving me, Alfred?” she asked, quivering.</p>

<p>“No. But it is my wish. That should
be enough.”</p>

<p>She was silent for a moment.</p>

<p>“It is enough,” she answered slowly, “your
wish shall be my law in this as in all things.
But you will take me up to town?” she
pleaded. “You can go to the Blue Lion, to
Steggalls’, and tell them to drive you back
to Liphook now.”</p>

<p>“I have no money with me,” he said
firmly.</p>

<p>“It will go down to my account, darling,”
she continued, as if she had not heard the
interruption. “You can take the quarter
to one train from Liphook to London; it
stops at Witley. I will be on the platform,
and we will go on together.” She ventured
to stand now, and held out her hands again,
almost entreatingly.</p>

<p>“You will say nothing to Sir William?”</p>

<p>“Alfred, you are my lord and master,”
and she bowed her head on to her breast.
But he was wholly untouched.</p>

<p>“Very well,” he said, “I will drive back
at once—there is not too much time—and
meet you as you say. Good-bye.” He
kissed her forehead, and as before, swiftly
drew back again.</p>

<p>“Will you order a waggonette for me too,
Alfred?” she asked as she followed him to
the door. “I shall want one to take me to
the station. Tell them to put it all down
to me.” He did not answer till the door
was open, and he saw the dark trees against
the sky, and the withered leaves beneath
lying on the garden pathway. Then a
smile crossed his lips, his face wore an air
of relief, he looked like a free man. He
crossed the threshold with a light step, and
stopped and looked over his shoulder at her.</p>

<p>“Good-bye,” he said. “I will order the
waggonette. It is lovely weather. We
shall enjoy the journey to town.”</p>

<p>“My darling,” she said, with a world of
tenderness in her voice, “I shall enjoy anything
with you as long as I live.” He
looked at her for a minute with the strange
dumb expression that was so peculiarly his
own, and walked away.</p>

<p>Mrs. Baines went back to the drawing-room,
and shut the door with a manner
that conveyed to the whole house that she
wanted to be alone for a little space. She
stood thoughtfully beside the chair on which
he had sat. Suddenly she caught sight of
her own face in the chimney-glass. She
looked at it critically and winked slowly,
she pulled the white handkerchief up a little
higher round her throat and turned away
satisfied. “He loves me,” she said, “I know
he loves me, and no power on earth shall
separate me from him. I will marry him
if I walk to church without my shoes. I
was faithless once, but this time I will be
true.” She crept softly upstairs, and when
she came down an hour later she was dressed
and ready to depart. She went to the
dining-room, where Florence in despair had
had a little luncheon-tray brought in with
sandwiches and biscuits on it.</p>

<p>“My love,” she said, “I have finished the
preparations for my journey; will you permit
your servants to bring down my luggage?
Steggalls’ man is coming immediately to
drive me to the station. Thank you, but
I do not need any refreshment.”</p>

<p>“Aunt Anne, I can’t bear you to go,”
poor Florence said in dismay.</p>

<p>“I must go—I cannot stay,” the old lady
answered solemnly, “and I beg you not to
ask me to do so again.”</p>

<p>“But you will come back?” Florence
entreated.</p>

<p>“No, I cannot,” Aunt Anne answered in
the same voice. “You did not mean it, but
you cut me to the quick last night; I have
had no sleep since, my love. I must go
away, I want to be alone. Besides, I have
private business to transact. Thank you for
all your goodness and hospitality to me, yours,
and your dear ones. It has been a great
privilege to be with you and the dear children
since Walter went away, and to come
here and see your second home.” She sat
down for a moment by the buttery-hatch,
turning a quick sharp glance as she did so to
see that it was well closed, for one of her firm
beliefs was that “servants were always ready
to listen to the private speech of their employers.”
As she seated herself, she looked
as if she were trying to practise some of
Mr. Wimple’s firmness.</p>

<p>But Florence knelt lovingly by the old
lady’s side, and put her pretty head down
on the black merino dress. “I would not
be unkind to you for the world,” she said,
“you know I would not.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Baines winked sorrowfully, but did
not falter.</p>

<p>“You were very unkind. You hurt me
more than I can say,” she said coldly.</p>

<p>Florence turned her lips towards the old
lady’s hands, and kissed them. “Aunt
Anne dear,” she said very softly, “you
have no money——” Mrs. Baines stiffened
herself, her voice became polite and distant.</p>

<p>“Thank you, my love, but I have sufficient
to defray the expenses of my journey; and
at the other end I shall be in a position to
make arrangements.”</p>

<p>“Let me lend you a little,” her niece said
humbly.</p>

<p>“No, my love”—and Mrs. Baines shook
her head—“I cannot take it.”</p>

<p>But Florence thought of the ten shillings
that constituted all the old lady’s funds, and
felt miserable.</p>

<p>“You could pay me back,” she pleaded.
“And don’t be angry, dear Aunt Anne, but
you told me how poor you were in that
lodging last year, and how cold; it makes
my heart ache every time I think of it; and
the winter and the cold are coming again.
Oh, do stay here. You shall do anything
in the world that makes you happy. I
cannot bear to think of you in London; and
it’s unkind of you to go, for we shall miss
you so much, the children and I——” and
she burst into tears.</p>

<p>Then Aunt Anne melted.</p>

<p>“Florence,” she said tenderly, “that was
like your dear self.”</p>

<p>“Then stay with us. You shall do as you
like in all ways.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, my love; and bless you for
your goodness. But I cannot stay. I do
love you, and I will believe that your heart
feels for me in this great crisis of my life.
You must not think that because I love him
I shall love you less; that would be impossible.
But you must allow me to terminate
my visit now. I want to be alone, to be in
retirement for a little while; besides I have, as
I said just now, imperative business to transact
in town. You must not ask me to prolong
my time here, love.”</p>

<p>“Let me, at any rate, be a little useful to
you, Aunt Anne. I know you are not rich.”</p>

<p>For a moment Aunt Anne was silent.
Then she winked her left eye very slowly,
and looked up.</p>

<p>“Florence,” she said, “I know that you
always mean your words, and I should not
like to hurt your generous heart. I will
prove my affection for you by letting you
lend me two sovereigns. Don’t ask me to
take more, my love, for it would be impossible.
There——” and she gave a long
sigh as she put the coins into her glove.
“Now I hope you are satisfied. Remember
I only take them to prove my affection for
you. Let me kiss those dear children;” and
quickly opening the door she called them
by their names, and laughed in an absent,
excited manner, as they came running down
the stairs. “Come, my darlings,” she said;
“Aunt Anne is going away, and wants to say
good-bye.”</p>

<p>“But we don’t want you to go,” said
Monty.</p>

<p>“We don’t want you to go at all,” echoed
Catty.</p>

<p>“You dear children,” the old lady said, “I
must go; but I shall not forget you, and
to-night when you look under your pillows
you will find some chocolates as usual. I
have put them there ready for you, so that
some day you might remember that, even in
the midst of her own happiness, Aunt Anne
thought of you.” She said the last words
almost mechanically, while with one eye she
watched her trunks being carried out, and
with the other looked at the children. Suddenly
she turned to Florence. “I should
like to wish you good-bye alone; there is
something I want to say to you.” She turned
quickly and entered the drawing-room. The
fire had burnt low, the room had grown
chilly, and Florence shivered a little as she
stood waiting for Aunt Anne to speak. “My
dear,” the old lady said, “will you try not to
think me ungrateful for all your care of
me, for all your solicitude for my happiness?
I know you think that I am in my
dotage——”</p>

<p>“Oh no——”</p>

<p>“—That I am doing a foolish thing in
marrying a man so much younger than
myself, that——”</p>

<p>“You must do as you like, Aunt Anne; it
is a free country, and we can all do as we
like.”</p>

<p>“Yes, my love,” Mrs. Baines answered
with a sudden wink, which showed that this
was a new bit of argument to her, and one
that she would try to use to her own advantage
if she had the opportunity; “we can
all do as we like, as you did when you
married your dear Walter, as I shall when I
marry Alfred Wimple, for, as you say, it is a
free country.”</p>

<p>“I only hope that you may be happy,”
Florence said earnestly.</p>

<p>“Yes, my love,” Mrs. Baines said, and her
eyes filled with tears, “I hope so too, and
that I may make him happy.” She was
silent for a minute, and then it seemed as if
what she said were forced from her. “I
wanted to tell you,” she began with a little
gasp, “I want you to know something in my
past life, so that you may better understand
the reason of what I am doing. When I
was a girl, Florence, a very true love was
given to me. I won it heedlessly, and did
not know its value. I played with it and
threw it away—a fresh young life like Alfred
Wimple’s. It was in my power to make
him happy; but I made him miserable. He
was taken ill and died. Sometimes I think
that I am answerable to God for the loss of
that life; had I acted differently it might
have been in the world now. I never had a
young love offered to me again; I thought
that God had denied it to me as a punishment;
for Mr. Baines’s youth had gone
when I married him; it was the marriage of
his middle age. But through all the years I
have not grown old, and all things that have
youth in them are precious to me. One
reason why I love you all—you, and Walter
and the children—is that I am young too, at
heart. It is only the lines on my face that
make me look old, and the years I can count
that make me feel so. I am young still in
all else.” She stopped for a moment, as if
waiting for some response, but Florence
could think of nothing to say; she looked at
the old lady wonderingly, and put her hand
on the nervous ones that rested on the chair-back.
“I remember the night of your party,”
Mrs. Baines went on. “I thought of the
past all the evening while I sat there—your
guest, my darling—it came back again and
again, it enveloped me, one year after
another. I went on to the balcony, and all
my dear ones who had gone gathered round
me in the darkness. I heard your fresh
young voices behind, but the years had set a
mark on me that cut me off from you, and
death had taken most of those I remembered,
but left my heart young and longing for love,
longing to live again just as you loved and
as you lived. I said to myself, ‘I am old, I
am old!’ Alfred Wimple was standing by
me, and whispered, ‘You are not old.’ He
was like my dead come back, like the one
who had loved me when I was young; I felt
as if through all the years I had been waiting
by a dead man’s side, but that now perhaps
out of his life that loved me this other had
grown, or else that God had sent him, my
dear one, into the world again to love me
once more, and to prove I was forgiven.
Do you understand, Florence? I could not
refuse the beautiful life that was laid at my
feet, the love that has come to bless me
once more after all the long years. We
are young man and young woman to each
other, and we love each other with all
our hearts. It is like you and your dear
Walter. I wanted to say this to you; I
thought it would help you to understand, to
sympathize with me. You cannot be sorry
that I am going to be less lonely, or grudge
me the love that will make my life happier.
That is all. And now, my darling, I must
go; and good-bye once more.”</p>

<p>Florence could not speak—she felt the hot
tears filling her eyes again—a lump had come
to her throat.</p>

<p>“God bless you, Aunt Anne,” she said at
last, with something almost like a sob.</p>

<p>“And God bless you, dearest Florence,”
the old lady said, and kissed her niece’s face
and stroked her head. “You know I always
admire your hair, my love,” she said, and
pulling her forward she kissed it. Then she
went out to the waggonette. Jane held open
the door. “This is for you,” Mrs. Baines
said haughtily, and slipped half a crown into
the servant’s hand. “There are some old
slippers in my bedroom; I don’t know if you
will deem them worthy of your acceptance.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, ma’am,” said Jane, unwillingly.</p>

<p>“I trust you will study your mistress’s
comfort and interests in every way,” Mrs.
Baines continued as she put a shawl over
her knees, “and that you will be good to
those dear children.” The next moment
she was on her way to Witley Station.</p>
